    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Since 2021, after returning home to care for elderly family members, I have been subjected to extreme and prolonged noise exposure from a neighboring church and, later, a bar across the street. What began as occasional loud music from a live band escalated into daily disturbances lasting hours, accompanied by structural vibrations and low-frequency pressure waves that now travel through my living space due to faulty soundproofing. On May 2024, the church installed a soundproof wall on our shared structure—without permits or professional oversight. This being after they were issued multiple noise violations by the DEP and ordered to mitigate the noise from their excessively loud sessions. This addition trapped low-frequency energy between layers of material, leading to constant floor and structural vibrations throughout my home.</p>
    
    <p>The central HVAC unit they placed on their extended roof, adjacent to this wall, now sends powerful low-frequency waves—especially around <strong>29Hz, 59Hz, and 117-120Hz</strong>—through my home, where they reverberate across the flooring and amplify through furniture, particularly in my private living space where I work and sleep. The result has been debilitating: I now suffer from <strong>hyperacusis, tinnitus, misophonia, phonophobia, headaches, dizziness, nausea and other health symptoms.</strong> The testing done by my specialized doctor will also show the frequencies I show extreme sensitivity to now, are the same frequencies and sounds produced by the church and their faulty soundproofing.</p>
    
    <p>
      This <strong>ongoing exposure</strong>—documented in videos, sound readings, and synchronized recordings—has caused significant physical injury and psychological harm.

      <strong>Key Support Pages:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Media Evidence:</strong> A library of audio/video recordings, spectrograms, and dB(C) readings showing low-frequency noise and vibrations.</li>
        <li><strong>Full Timeline:</strong> Chronological breakdown of all major events, complaints, medical milestones, and structural changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Medical Information:</strong> Diagnoses from multiple doctors detailing the progression and nature of the injuries sustained from the noise exposure.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Intent</h2>
    <p>
      This case outlines a failure of the property owner (church), and possibly, the city of New York, and local enforcement—to prevent a preventable injury. The evidence shows a direct correlation between the structural modifications made by the church and the onset of my condition. This front page exists to guide legal review and present a clear path to documentation, evidence, and medical impact.
    </p>
    <p>Here are the liabilities I believe the church might have:</p>

  <h3 style="color: #2c3e50;">1. Nuisance (Private & Potentially Public)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chronic Noise Disturbance:</strong> Music sessions from 2006 onward, escalating drastically after 2021, especially with drums, live bands, and bass.</li>
    <li><strong>Violates NYC Noise Code:</strong> Documented multiple times by 311, DEP, and NYPD — including over-limit decibel readings which they were issued multiple violations.</li>
    <li><strong>Continued Operation After Complaints:</strong> Even after being notified (NYPD 2021, DEP 2023), they continued without meaningful mitigation.</li>
    <li><strong>Ignored Mediation Outcome:</strong> Failed to comply with reasonable standards after the MEND NYC mediation failed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="color: #2c3e50;">2. Negligent Construction / Negligent Soundproofing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Unprofessional Soundproofing:</strong> Installed soundproofing without professional consultation or sound environmental impact evaluation conducted on our side of the house (May 2024).</li>
    <li><strong>HVAC Impact:</strong> Improper HVAC installation or operation — central air unit is actively producing low-frequency vibrations into my floors and home (29–120 Hz range).</li>
    <li><strong>Foreseeable Risk:</strong> Created a situation where vibrations penetrate the shared structure and result in injury (hyperacusis, tinnitus, etc.).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="color: #2c3e50;">3. Negligence Resulting in Injury</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Failure to Act:</strong> Despite being informed of my condition, they continued harmful behavior.</li>
    <li><strong>Causation:</strong> Injury is well-documented through my timeline, meter data, medical visits, and sound expert consultations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="color: #2c3e50;">4. Violation of Building Codes / Improper Use of Premises</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Structural & Zoning Violations:</strong> Concert stage, HVAC setup, and use of a residential property for amplified events may violate zoning and DOB regulations.</li>
    <li><strong>History of Violation:</strong> Already had a Partial Vacate Order in 2021 — shows the City recognized improper or unsafe usage.</li>
  </ul>
