      <h2><span class="icon">🧭</span> Project Flow at a Glance</h2>
      <p class="tagline">
        We build in clear phases so you always know what you’re getting and what you’re paying for.
      </p>
      <ul class="phase-list">
        <li>
          <span class="phase-title">Phase 1 – Kickoff & Setup</span><br />
          We agree on the features, layout, and goals. We set up your base system and start building
          the core screens.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="phase-title">Phase 2 – Core Features</span><br />
          The main tools you’ll use every day (for example, bookings, simple dashboard, or inventory)
          are implemented and clickable.

        <li>
          <span class="phase-title">Phase 3 – Polish & Adjustments</span><br />
          We refine the layout, fix issues, and adjust details based on your feedback.

        <li>
          <span class="phase-title">Phase 4 – Launch & Handoff</span><br />
          We prepare the system to go live, walk you through it, and deliver final access.

      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Section: Payments -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2><span class="icon">💳</span> Payments & Milestones</h2>
      <p class="tagline">
        You pay in steps, not all at once — each payment matches a clear milestone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of paying everything upfront or at the very end, we split your project into a few
        simple payment stages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="highlight">Kickoff Payment (around 30%)</span> – paid when we start.
          This covers planning, setup, and reserving development time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="highlight">Midpoint Payment (around 25%)</span> – paid when the core
          features are working and you can click through them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="highlight">Pre-Delivery Payment (around 25%)</span> – paid when everything
          is built and we’re in the finishing stages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="highlight">Final Payment (around 10–20%)</span> – paid right before launch
          and handoff.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This way, you only pay as real progress is delivered, and we both have clear checkpoints.
      </p>
      <div class="pill-row">
        <div class="pill">No surprise bills</div>
        <div class="pill">Progress-based payments</div>
        <div class="pill">Clear milestones</div>
      </div>

    <!-- Section: Revisions & Time Control -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2><span class="icon">✏️</span> Revisions & Time Limits</h2>
      <p class="tagline">
        You absolutely get revisions — we just keep them organized so the project doesn’t drag forever.
      </p>
      <p>For each phase of the project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You get up to <span class="highlight">2 rounds of revisions</span> included in the price
          for that phase.
        </li>
        <li>
          Revisions should be requested within
          <span class="highlight">7 days of receiving that phase</span> (for example, the first
          working version of your booking page or dashboard).
        </li>
        <li>
          Revisions mean adjustments to what we already agreed on: wording, colors, layout tweaks,
          moving elements, small feature changes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To avoid last-minute chaos right before launch, any new revision requests made
        <span class="highlight">less than 5 days before the agreed go-live date</span> may be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Moved into a <span class="highlight">post-launch update</span>, or
        </li>
        <li>
          Priced as extra work if they significantly change what’s already built.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This keeps the project moving smoothly and makes sure launch dates stay realistic.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section: Big Changes / Scope -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2><span class="icon">🧱</span> Big Changes vs Normal Tweaks</h2>
      <p class="tagline">
        Small tweaks are included. Major direction changes are treated as new work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Normal revisions are things like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Can we move this section higher on the page?”</li>
        <li>“Please change this color or label.”</li>
        <li>“Can we adjust this field or add a note here?”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A <span class="highlight">major change</span> is something like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“We want a completely different layout now.”</li>
        <li>“We’ve changed our mind, and want a different set of features.”</li>
        <li>“We want this to work like a different type of system altogether.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When that happens, we’ll pause, talk it through, and if needed, treat it as a
        <span class="highlight">new mini-phase with its own price and timeline</span>. We won’t
        move forward on extra work until we both agree in writing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section: Cancelling / Pausing -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2><span class="icon">⏸️</span> If You Pause or Cancel the Project</h2>
      <p class="tagline">
        You’re free to stop at any time — we just make sure completed work is covered fairly.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can pause or cancel the project at any time with written notice (email is fine).
        </li>
        <li>
          The <span class="highlight">kickoff payment is non-refundable</span> once we start, as
          it covers initial planning and setup.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any phases that are already completed or in progress still need to be paid for. Future
          phases that haven’t started yet are not charged.
        </li>
        <li>
          You’ll receive all work that has been fully paid for up to that point.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Section: Ownership -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2><span class="icon">📜</span> Ownership of the Work</h2>
      <p class="tagline">
        You own what you pay for. We keep ownership of anything that isn’t fully paid yet.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Once a phase is fully paid, you have the right to use that part of the system for your
          business.
        </li>
        <li>
          Until a phase is paid, the underlying code, design, and materials remain our property.
        </li>
        <li>
          This protects both sides: you’re not paying for things you don’t receive, and we’re not
          giving away unpaid work.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Section: Communication -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2><span class="icon">📞</span> Communication & Response Times</h2>
      <p class="tagline">
        Good communication keeps the project on track and avoids rushed changes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We’ll agree on a main contact person on your side (owner or manager) and on our side.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most updates and approvals will be done by email so we have a clear record.
        </li>
        <li>
          When we send a phase for review, a response within
          <span class="highlight">5–7 days</span> helps keep the schedule on track.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you ever feel unsure about where we’re at, ask — we’ll happily walk you through the
        current status and next steps.
