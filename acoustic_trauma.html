                <h3>2008 - 2018</h3>
                <h5>A second church group utilizes the venue.</h5>
                <p>In approximately 2010 - 2012, an Indonesian church group is allowed to utilize the church venue, bringing live bands, drums, and significantly louder music. Early Sunday morning sessions (7-8 a.m.) became disruptive weekly. My family started filing 311 complaints and calling the precinct as the noise escalated, but the relief was only temporary if there was any at all. Within this duration, the church also underwent construction several times and extended the back of the church which now blocks our backyard, and what may be a violation and illegal extension. I believe they aren't properly zoned to have commercial space and this may need further proper research from an expert. Regardless, this allows them to install central air unit on that roof of the extension, as well as add a concert stage in the back of their first floor apartment, which they now converted into a commercial open event space equipped with a concert stage that's now located on the other side of my parents bedroom.</p>

                    <h5>2012 - 2018</h5>
                    <p>The music sessions get louder gradually, but they remain predictable (around 10-15 minutes per session, several scheduled times a week). Noise complaints are filed occasionally via phone to the 110th precinct or via 311, but they only result in short-term relief, with the noise recurring every few weeks and gradually reverting back to excessive levels. 
                        
                        <br><br>I have always questioned this issue with my uncle, but my mom states he or his son claimed they weren't able to do anything about the noise because the church might've had some government connections, as my uncle use to talk to an officer of the 110th precinct who attended the church often during their sessions. Regardless we questioned even if they were allowed to build there in the first place. From what I remember, I was much younger and didn't really know any better let alone anything about the laws and city codes. My mother was also much younger and was more active outdoors with my little sister growing up, as opposed to now, where she isn't very mobile, she's retired and resting at home more often, and this means can't get away from the church noise a lot of the times.</p>

                <h3>April 2021</h3>
                <h5>Huge Difference from before</h5>
                <p>After covid, I decided to move back home to pursue a career change while keeping a closer eye on my parents, after my dad was extremely sick and hospitalized from covid. I immediately noticed a significant increase in noise levels. It seemed the church introduces a full live band in a concert like event with amplifying equipment and loud microphones. The sessions last much longer (four to six hours vs 10-15 minutes). The new pastor’s son, a music teacher, holds random music classes throughout the day, making the noise unpredictable and much more frequent.</p>
                <br><span class="show-more">Read More</span>
                <div class="details">
                    <p>Despite the disruptions, I focus on my Data/Programming Course and continue trying to pursue my studies and journey into computer science, however, the noise interferes with my evening classes (Tuesdays and Thursdays) and the church's sessions are held at the exact same time as classes are scheduled at 7:00pm - 10:00pm. 

                        <br><br>My dad continues to struggle to rest and recover, my mom is exposed as frequently as I am, and is also closer to the source. She informs me its gotten bad to the point where her picture frames hung in her room have fallen off and broken at times. I begin thinking about and planning how to take my parents with me to California, and away from this. But in the meantime, I was going to speak with the church in case my parents wanted to stay in New York where all our family and friends are, and regardless to fix this ongoing issue that has now gotten much worse, for my parents, myself and my grand uncle if he has any other tenants move in after.</p>

                <h3>June 19, 2021</h3>
                <h5>A Tipping Point</h5>
                <p>My little sister passes away on a Saturday, and the noise from the church continues without any reprieve the next morning after her passing, and essentially almost the whole afternoon that Sunday. This adds to the family's grief and frustration, and causes me to hold off on taking any immediate further action for the time being. You can imagine the impact it has not being able to fully grieve after a loss like that in the family.</p>

                <h3>July 2021</h3>
                <h5>First interaction with the church since returning home.</h5>
                <p>My first interaction with the church after a few months back and realizing they weren't going to quiet down. I was studying while the church was playing loud music, likely as part of a teaching session for Julian (the pastor's son) who holds music classes. The music was so loud that I had to yell just to get their attention. Julian and two students, including one in the control room, were present. Although already visibly upset, I asked them to turn down the volume. Julian responded that they would "try to turn it down," but there was no noticeable change after this at all. I give it some time in case they were planning to fix the issue.</p>

                <p>I called the precinct for some help to come resolve the noise issue. Officer Luis Motato of the 110th Precinct called me and helped notify them of our complaint.</p>

The officer and his team arrived after the church session had finished and informed the church of the issue and gave them an official notice a neighbor had complained about their noise. I mention to him it's fine if they know it's us, because I already spoke to them once before.</p>

                <h5>Second Interaction with the church.</h5>
                <p>I returned a second time and politely asked them to turn it down, now during the beginning of a full evening session. The new pastor(the old pastor's son) was dismissive, claiming the church is allowed to play music. Tony tried explaining that it wasn’t about playing music, but the excessive volume and bass, mainly the drums and the bass. Cesar, the original pastor's son-in-law, stepped in to help translate(the pastor's english is very limited) but did not provide much input. The pastor again said they would "try to turn it down," but no change occurred after this interaction either. </p>

                    <p>I inform my uncle/landlord of the situation and let him know what happened. I let him know they're much more excessive than before and that I will start filing 311 complaints and report them to the police. He encourages me to do so and states they shouldn't be allowed to continue to bother us and it has been so many years. I inform him that their establishment shouldn't even be allowed to build there it seems. He lets me know he's also suspicious of how they were able to get approved to build a church attached to us. He believes they might've found some loop holes or know some officials to be able to get approved. He mentions an officer of the 110th precinct use to be a patron of the church and they spoke a few times during the church sessions. I let him know he needs to get a lawyer to probably fight that case in court, but I'll look into it and see what I can find and if I can find some free consultation or help.</p>

                    <p>I was so upset at her response and how dismissive she was. It also didn't help how defensive of the church she was without even really letting me explain, which I felt wasn't even fair and showed biased. I basically attempted to explain to her the church was very loud. And she proceeded to tell me I filed a complaint with 311, however I didn't get the operator's name or anything at the time, so it was just a random complaint probably. To be honest, I was more riled up at her behaviour and unwillingness to even hear me out or help, than actually trying to get her in any kind of trouble. And I certainly didn't expect a response like that.</p>

                <h5>Involving the DOB</h5>
                <p>After seeing no improvements and the ineffectiveness of going over and politely requesting they turn the bass down, I begin filing 311 complaints more and more often until the end of the year in November. Realizing the church might be illegally converted while researching how they were even allowed to build a church next door in the first place, I contacted the Department of Buildings (DOB) in October 2021 and reported the establishment for Illegal Conversion. This resulted in them being fined and issued a partial vacate order in November 2021 for one year. The church received numerous violations and fines from the Department of Buildings.</p>

                <p>The first video includes an early recording in 2023 of when I first started using the db(C) sound meter in recordings. The recording is done in my parent's room on a Sunday session for the Church. 
                <br><br>
                 The Second video includes the Bar's sound levels recorded from inside my hallway and is comparable to what I would hear if my windows were open in my room just on the other side of the wall on the right side. The music levels represent how they play everyday from 10pm to 4am, non-stop, for 7 days a week.

                <h5>Short, quiet, and productive year.</h5>
                <p>The year was mostly quiet due to the church stopping their operations until the end of the year. During this time, I was able to focus on really learning and expanding on the field of computer science, which I was denied the time to do when the church was open and during the actual live classes. I was also able develop multiple business ideas and pursuits now that I understood the depths of my new field much more and was able to expand my skillset tremendously.</p><br><br>

                    <h5>Refreshers.</h5>
                    <p>In 2022, I attempted to pick up on multiple studies and discovered online resources to learn pretty much anything I wanted with the resourceful skills I obtained so far. I explored and built multiple programming and projects with Ai on various platforms and really started feeling passionate about my work and studies. I decided I didn't want to stop expanding my skills but needed a job where I could also look after my elderly parents and pets now with my little sister gone, and no one else to take care of them. I proceeded to brain storm business ideas and how I could work remotely or from home, which was the perfect place since I could take care of my elderly parents, pets and keep an eye on my aging grand uncle as well, since his kids all moved out.</p>

                <h5>Soft Reopening</h5>
                <p>The church resumed activities in November 2022, holding 2-3 sessions between November and December before reopening fully in January 2023. I immediately noticed the noise hadn't improved after a few weeks, and started filing 311 complaints and calling the 110th precinct again by January 29, 2023.</p><br><br>

                <h5>The disturbance returns, amplified.</h5>
                <p>In January 2023, the church fully reopened. I noticed in their soft reopening sessions late 2022, the music was still loud. However, I waited to see and give them some time to adjust it. The music actually got louder, as they attempted to announce their reopening to the neighborhood. After pretty much one month, starting January 29, 2023, I filed 311 complaints in regards to the noise they had each session.</p><br><br>

                <h5>First Attempt of Noise Mitigation</h5>
                <p>I am in contact with Cesar and he calls me over to discuss their plans of mitigating the sounds. He mentions they are considering soundproofing and I agree this is a good decision and he should get a sound consultant. On March 2, 2023, I send Cesar a list of sound consultants approved by the DEP from the government website list. For this, I have phone records in the form of text messages and email. Through the following weeks, no soundproofing measures are taken on a construction level. When asked, they stated they moved around the speakers and added a sound absorbant pad for drums. However, on my side there was no difference in the sound levels, only in the balance of the sounds. Eventually by late April, the noise really hasn't changed, and it seems all they've done was move the speakers around. There was no real mitigation tactics in regards to real soundproofing in place for the level of sound they were producing from a fully equipped live band with speakers, and a choir. I remained patient as I understood soundproofing is costly. However, since there was no difference and the sound always reverted back to being loud, I questioned whether they were stalling to buy time.</p>

                <h5>April 11 - 14 Another NYPD Notice</h5>
                <p>After filing 311 complaints for months, I received information to contact the neighborhood coordinator from the 110th precinct. I contact Officer Fuentes for the first time, and he sets up a visit to come witness the noise first hand on a Friday night. The officer witnesses the disturbance first hand and tells me there isn't anything he can do. He states he can let the church someone complained. I inform please do so, and they most likely know it's us, so it's confidentiality isn't an issue for us. He proceeds to inform the church and him and his partner give me their card and leave.</p><br><br>

                    <h5>NYPD First hand witnesses</h5>
                    <p> It's important to note, Officer Fuentes and his partner arrived to the scene with a marked SUV and parks right in front of the church and my house in our shared driveway. The officer walks right into their building, and I had to call out to let him know I was the one who called him. 

                    The church obviously startled by the police arriving, play much quieter than usual, however it's still pretty excessive enough.
        
                    Officer Fuentes informs me he will inform the church and issue them a verbal warning, but informs me that basically, he can't do anything about it but let them know someone complained, and he can't force them to get soundproofing. I inform him it's okay, and they most likely know it's us as I visited them privated first on a few occasions before. I ask if the Officer has sound meters so maybe we can get some readings. He lets me know me they do have sound meters but they're being used for noisy cars in the park and there weren't that many availalble for him to use or go around. I asked him what he thought I should do.
                    
                    Officer Fuentes and his partner's suggestion was that I should move or sue the church. I let him know that really wasn't something I was ready to do to a long time neighbor yet. He then mentions I could try the community board or contacting the DEP somehow.</p>

                <h5>Videos of Sunday, May 7, 2023 for the Church</h5>
                <p>The videos includes a recording in May of 2023 of a Sunday afternoon session which started at 9am. The first video is of a 9am drumming session, and what I would hear every Sunday starting 2023. Although it isn't painfully loud, it is audible, and continous and constant. 
                    
                    This would go on for about 30 - 45 minutes for their morning session. The recording is a video with audio taken on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 capturing a sound meter app I am using on my tablet. The location is in my room on a small table.<br><br>

                    The second video is continuing later in the session at 2pm. This is live session with the choir and all the equipment turned on. Towards the end of the video, I take the recording out into my living room and where you can still hear their music, basically stretching from one side of my house to the other. This is what I mean by I have no escape from the sound no matter where I am in my house.

                <h3>May 2023</h3>
                <h5>First DEP Inspection</h5>
                <p>DEP Inspector Reynoso returned from vacation and scheduled a Friday evening inspection. Before the inspection, I gave clear instructions not to enter the church or alert them to his presence. I reiterated this on the day of the inspection, but despite that, he walked right into the church, flashed his badge, and I had to call out to him.<br><br>

                    This was problematic because, if you’re inspecting noise levels, you shouldn’t warn the source beforehand. Regardless, the music was so loud that he measured it as over the legal limit using a dB(A) weighted scale. I believe a bass measurement using db(C) would have shown even more excessive noise.<br><br>
                    
                    During the inspection, Reynoso commented that his own apartment was louder, which felt biased since he's supposed to enforce the noise code based on legal limits, not personal comparisons. The church was clearly in violation. However, his partner was much more empathetic to what me and my mom were going through, but I believe he was there more to shadow Inspector Reynoso while still training.<br><br>
                    
                    Inspector Reynoso then informed me he couldn’t fine the church as he had no jurisdiction but agreed he would warn them. He let's me know to just contact him again if anything though, but provides no clear way to do so as well as pretty much just telling me he can't really help me anyway.<br><br>

I sign the MEND "Consent to Mediate" form and email the document to Sharon Osbourne on May 12, 2023.<br><br>
                    Later, during mediation, the church confirmed they received a warning but were also told by the DEP Inspector that he couldn’t issue them fines, which in my opinion, allowed them to continue their activities with hardly any adjustments.<br><br>
