      <h2>1️⃣ Early Noise Issues & Government Involvement (2006 - 2021)</h2><span>
      <div class="entry"><strong>2006-2018:<span class="tag-event">Excessive Sound Levels</span></strong> <span>Church buys the property and gradually increases noise. Starting from quiet prayer sessions, to adding a choir, microphone & speakers, and then a live band with full instrumentals(drums, guitar, piano).</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>April 2021:<span class="tag-event">Excessive Sound Levels</span></strong> <span>After COVID, I return home to care for my elderly parents and notice major escalation—sessions last 4-6 hours, almost everyday, interfering with my family's health and wellbeing, with my father recovering from a serious illness, and my career switch into data programming. I begin giving the church, and local authorities notice of the noise issues.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>October 2021:<span class="tag-violation">DOB Violations</span></strong> <span>After months of no changes. Contacted DOB for possible illegal conversion, resulting in Partial Vacate Order for a year & multiple violations.</span></div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2️⃣ The Church's Non-Compliance & First Health Impacts (2022 - 2023)</h2><span>

        <div class="entry"><strong>January - November 2022:<span class="tag-violation">Partial Vacate Shutdown</span></strong>Church temporarily shuts down due to DOB violations.</span></div>

        <div class="entry"><strong>November-December 2022:<span class="tag-event">Excessive Sound Levels</span></strong><span>Church reopens, noise immediately returns to pre-closure levels.</span></div>

        <div class="entry"><strong>February 2023:<span class="tag-notice">Notice</span></strong> <span>Serious verbal notice to the church, warning them legal action is possible.</span></div>
        <div class="entry"><strong>2023:<span class="tag-notice">Notice</span></strong> <span>After a temporary shutdown in 2022 due to building violations, the church resumed operations at full volume by late that year. Despite repeated efforts to resolve the issue—including a serious verbal warning, multiple 311 complaints, a firsthand visit by Officer Fuentes from the 110th Precinct, and a DEP inspection confirming sound violations—no meaningful changes were made. Mediation failed, and excessive sound levels persisted. This led me to contact the DEP in regards to the noise which prompted an inspection in March 2024.<br><br></span></div>
      </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3️⃣ Unrelenting Noise Exposure (Late 2023 - Early 2024)</h2>
      <div class="entry"><strong>March 2024:</strong> <span class="tag-violation">Officially Documented Sound Levels & Violations issued</span><span>Second DEP visit → sound levels 20 decibels over the violation limit found, church fined and ordered to a noise mitigation plan which leads the church to install soundproofing.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>May 2024:<span class="tag-medevent">The Trauma Incident</span></strong> <span>Church attempts soundproofing on our shared wall, but improper installation and lack of a sound expert consultation, worsens low-frequency exposure, and begins creating strange waves of vibrations into my entire apartment, and can be felt through my floor.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>June 2024:<span class="tag-medevent">Severe Medical Health Crisis</span><span class="tag-notice">Notice of health effects.</span></strong> <span>Severe health crisis → nausea, dizziness, vertigo, induced heart-rate, short breathing patterns, brain fog, tinnitus attacks, and inability to stay near low-frequency sounds. I notify the church, directly informing them of the symptoms me and my mother have been experiencing, and show them my readings of strange low frequency vibrations and letting them know I suspect it is from the Central A/C unit located visibly on the roof of their first floor extension. The pastor's son disagrees and stated everything was done properly, and there was no HVAC system on the roof, although it could still be seen, visibly operating.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>June - July 2024:<span class="tag-medevent">Medical Diagnosis</span></strong> <span>After experiencing extremely severe symptoms, I reach out to my doctors and visit Dr. Allan Levin, ENT specialist. I describe to the doctor my symptoms, particularly about extremely loud sounds, and in a sudden realization and almost shock, the doctor diagnoses me with "Acoustic PhonoTrauma". He then apologizes and tells me he cannot treat me, and informs me to seek a second opinion. </span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>June - July 2024:<span class="tag-medevent">Medical Testing & Diagnosis</span></strong> <span>Seeking further medical advice, I visit Dr. Stephen Warman, another ENT specialist. The doctor issues a hearing test conducted by audiologist, Dr. Vasilia Meskouris, who conducts a general loudness threshold test and finds my hearing sensitivity to be lower for someone my age. It's important to note, this test did not include sounds under 200hz, which is in the range of which my trigger sounds fall. Dr. Stephen Warman, also issued an MRI for my inner ear in case due to my symptoms of brain fog, loss of balance and reduced cognitive function. In the end, he confirms the diagnosis of Hyperacusis and Tinnitus. He states the same as Dr. Levin, and informs me the condition is permanent and there is no cure. The advice of the doctor was to "avoid noise". He did refer me to possibly seek treatment with a Dr. Sean Mcmenomey at NYU Langone. </span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>July 2024:<span class="tag-medevent">Medical Diagnosis & Referral</span></strong> <span>Dr. Sean Mcmenomey confirms Hyperacusis, and Tinnitus diagnosis, but is still unable to offer any kind of cure or treatment. The doctor refers me to a Hyperacusis specialist, a Dr. Susan E. Adams. I attempt to contact Dr. Adams immediately, however I reach her assistant who informs me the initial consulation is 15 mins and free, however, further evaluation would be costly and not covered by any insurance. The treatment was approximately $5500 to start with the equipment and on-going therapy sessions could be around $200-$300 an hour after the inital 6 months. As I didnt have the money for the treatment right away, I began finding other ways to cope in the meantime. </span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>August - September 2024:<span class="tag-medevent">Health & Trauma Coping Strategies</span></strong> <span>For the remainder of the summer, I experience extreme and horrible health symptoms daily, and resort to traveling far out of the city, only able to return at night when all the sounds and vibrations have calmed. This was a very difficult time with a plethora of uncertainties lying ahead.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>October 2024:<span class="tag-medevent">Medical Consultation and Diagnosis</span></strong> <span>Dr. Susan E. Adams diagnoses Hyperacusis, Tinnitus, and suspects a condition called Misophonia via phone consultation; refers me to a Dr. Natan Bauman.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>November 2024:<span class="tag-medevent">Medical Consultation</span></strong> <span>During our first consultation, Dr. Bauman pre-diagnoses me with Hyperacusis, Misophonia, Phonophobia; orders more tests and custom hearing aids to be ready.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>December 31, 2024:<span class="tag-medevent">Medical Testing, Evaluation, and Diagnosis.</span></strong> <span>Dr. Bauman conducts several hearing tests and programs the custom hearing aids for my specific conditions in a 5 hour visit. He officially diagnoses me with Hyperacusis, Misophonia, Phonophobia, and Tinnitus.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>January 1, 2025:<span class="tag-medevent">Treatment and Therapy Training Begins.</span></strong> <span>I begin the treatment and therapy retraining process as well as continue to seek help from the authorities as well as legal counsel. After leaving my home for a few days for the doctor visit in Connecticut, I notice a drastic change in my health for the better. I felt I was able to breathe slightly better, my heart was beating alittle bit more normal, and my mind was more clear. The headaches subsided, and the burping stopped. Unfortunately, this didn't last for long as the symptoms came right back when I returned home. I struggled with retraining and was still unable to stay in my home.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>January 16, 2025:<span class="tag-medevent">More Construction.</span></strong> <span>Approximately 11:00PM, I notice the some construction sounds from the church. I then hear drilling, hammering, etc, on the wall we share. I document the incident as file a request for an update for an inspection on their faulty soundproofing. After this incident, I felt the vibrations and sounds in the house change with less intensity, however still constant and present. The inspection by the DOB isn't conducted until months later, and is miscommunicated, with the inspector not mentioning anything about the soundproofing wall, and checked for other past alterations prior to the soundproofing on our shared wall. After they finally update the report, I file another inspection request later in April, this time for the inspector to also visit our house and side of the building, once again informing them of feeling strange vibrations in my home.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>February 2025:<span class="tag-medevent">Additional Support.</span></strong> <span>After struggling with the treatment and therapy retraining process but being able to deal with the issue slightly better(I suspect this is due to their adjustments on January 16, 2025), I reach out for further help to cope with the stress, with a psychotherapist who specializes with trauma patients, a Madeleine White LMSW. Miss White has helped with executing a variety of grounding techniques, coping mechanisms, and other therapeutic methods to not only deal with the sound trauma, but the heavy amount of stress and life changing issues, that my family and I now have to possibly deal with for the rest of our lives.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>April 18, 2025:<span class="tag-medevent">More Drilling.</span></strong> <span>After filing multiple complaints with the DOB in regards to obtaining an inspection for illegal alteration. The church makes more attempts to 'fix' the issue and can be heard drilling on the shared wall again. This again, adjusts the way sounds are being heard in my room, and in the house as well.</span></div>
