                <h3>2008 - 2018</h3>
                <h5>A second church group utilizes the venue.</h5>
                <p>In approximately 2010 - 2012, an Indonesian church group is allowed to utilize the church venue, bringing live bands, drums, and significantly louder music. Early Sunday morning sessions (7-8 a.m.) became disruptive weekly. My family started filing 311 complaints and calling the precinct as the noise escalated, but the relief was only temporary if there was any at all. Within this duration, the church also underwent construction several times and extended the back of the church which now blocks our backyard, and what may be a violation and illegal extension. I believe they aren't properly zoned to have commercial space and this may need further proper research from an expert. Regardless, this allowed them to add a concert stage towards the back of their first floor apartment, which they now converted into a commercial open event space equipped with a concert stage that's now located on the other side of my parents bedroom. As well as install a central air unit and another ventilation unit on top of that roof of the extension.</p>

                    <h5>2012 - 2018</h5>
                    <p>The music sessions get louder gradually, but they remain predictable (around 10-15 minutes per session, several scheduled times a week). Noise complaints are filed occasionally via phone to the 110th precinct or via 311, but they only result in short-term relief, with the noise recurring every few weeks and gradually reverting back to excessive levels. 
                        
                        <br><br>I have always questioned this issue with my uncle, but my mom states he or his son claimed they weren't able to do anything about the noise because the church might've had some government connections, as my uncle use to talk to an officer of the 110th precinct who attended the church often during their sessions. Regardless we questioned even if they were allowed to build there in the first place. From what I remember, I was much younger and didn't really know any better let alone anything about the laws and city codes. My mother was also much younger and was more active outdoors with my little sister growing up, as opposed to now, where she isn't very mobile, she's retired and resting at home more often, and this means can't get away from the church noise a lot of the times.</p>

                <h3>April 2021</h3>
                <h5>Huge Difference from before</h5>
                <p>After covid, I decided to move back home to pursue a career change while keeping a closer eye on my parents, after my dad was extremely sick and hospitalized from covid. I immediately noticed a significant increase in noise levels. It seemed the church introduces a full live band in a concert like event fashion, with amplifying equipment and loud microphones. The sessions last much longer (four to six hours vs. 10-15 minutes). The new pastor’s son, a music teacher, holds random music classes throughout the day, making the noise unpredictable and much more frequent.</p>
                <br><span class="show-more">Read More</span>
                <div class="details">
                    <p>Despite the disruptions, I focus on my Data/Programming Course and continue trying to pursue my studies and journey into computer science, however, the noise interferes with my evening classes (Tuesdays and Thursdays) and the church's sessions are held at the exact same time as classes are scheduled at 7:00pm - 10:00pm. As well as their other usual disruptive sessions, and practices, which were also extremely lengthy. Further disrupting my ability to fully focus learning an entirely new career and relinquishes me to have to spend a lot extra time later going over the work, now without the resources and live support that was available to me, and which I paid for, during the class hours.  

                        <br><br>My dad continues to struggle to rest and recover, my mom is exposed as frequently as I am, and is also closer to the source. She informs me its gotten bad to the point where her picture frames hung in her room have fallen off and broken at times. I begin thinking about and planning how to take my parents with me to California, and away from this. But in the meantime, I was going to speak with the church in case my parents wanted to stay in New York where all our family and friends are, and regardless to fix this ongoing issue that has now gotten much worse, for my parents, myself and my grand uncle if he has any other tenants move in after.</p>

                <h3>June 19, 2021</h3>
                <h5>A Tipping Point</h5>
                <p>My little sister passes away on a Saturday, and the noise from the church continues without any reprieve the next Sunday morning after her passing at 7 A.M. and for the rest of Sunday afternoon. This adds to my family's grief and frustration, and causes me to hold off on taking any immediate further action for the time being. You can imagine the impact it has not being able to fully grieve after an unexpected loss like that in the family.</p>

                    <h5>Inevitable</h5>
                    <p>This was a strong indication they weren't going to stop nor aware of the harm they were causing. A tipping point for me in which I realized, they have been mistreating my family for way too long and now they've even ramped it up. And if my parents decide to stay here, I can't put this off anymore. Especially if I'm going to leave, because there's no way any child would leave knowing their parents just have to continue living under these seriously unhealthy and really, unlivable conditions.</p>

                <h3>July 2021</h3>
                <h5>First interaction with the church since returning home.</h5>
                <p>My first interaction with the church after a few months back and realizing they weren't going to quiet down. I was studying while the church was playing loud music, likely as part of a teaching session for Julian (the pastor's son) who holds music classes. The music was so loud that I had to yell just to get their attention. Julian and two students, including one in the control room, were present. I was visibly upset, and I asked them to turn down the volume. Julian responded that they would "try to turn it down," but there was no noticeable change after this at all. I give it some time in case they were planning to fix the issue.</p>

                <h5>NYPD Response from the local 110th Precinct. Officer Luis Motato</h5>
                <p>I called the precinct for some help to come resolve the noise issue. Officer Luis Motato of the 110th Precinct called me and helped notify them of our complaint. I have a text message phone record that I sent the officer thanking him for helping documentation of this event.</p>

                    <p>They are not allowed to disturb the church during service, therefore the NYPD, always comes before or after. The officer and his team arrived after the church session had finished and informed the church of the issue and gave them an official notice a neighbor had complained about their noise. I mention to him it's fine if they know it's us, because I already spoke to them once before.</p>

                <h5>Second Interaction with the church.</h5>
                <p>I returned a second time and politely asked them to turn it down, now at the beginning of a full evening session. The new pastor(the old pastor's son) was dismissive, claiming the church is allowed to play music. I tried explaining that it wasn’t about playing music, but the excessive volume and bass, mainly the drums and the bass. Cesar, the original pastor's son-in-law, stepped in to help translate(the pastor's english is very limited) but did not provide much input. The pastor again said they would "try to turn it down," but no change occurred after this interaction either. </p>

                    <p>I inform my uncle/landlord of the situation and let him know what happened. I let him know they're much more excessive than before and that I will start filing 311 complaints and report them to the police. He encourages me to do so and states they shouldn't be allowed to continue to bother us and it has been so many years. I inform him that their establishment shouldn't even be allowed to build there it seems. He lets me know he's also suspicious of how they were able to get approved to build a church attached to us. He believes they might've found some loop holes or know some officials to be able to get approved. He mentions an officer of the 110th precinct use to be a patron of the church and they spoke a few times during the church sessions. I let him know he needs to get a lawyer to probably fight that case in court, but I'll look into it and see what I can find and if I can find some free consultation or help.</p>

                <h5>A horrible and very discouraging experience with the NYPD 110th Police Precinct Operator again. 311 Complaint filed against the precinct operator</h5>
                <p>Stopped calling the precinct for now after precinct operator very reluctant to help after multiple tries. I started filing 311 SR-Reports starting August 15, 2021.</p>

                    <h5>NYPD Operator Complaint</h5>
                    <p>I was so upset at her response and how dismissive she was. It also didn't help how defensive of the church she was without even really letting me explain, which I felt wasn't even fair and showed biased. I basically attempted to explain to her that I didn't have a problem with them playing church music, but the church was very loud and it was more about the sound levels coming into my house. And she proceeded to tell me the church was allowed to play music. To which I replied yes, but it shouldn't be excessively loud entering my home. She was completely dismissive and basically hung up on me. 
                    <br><br>    
                    I filed a complaint with 311, however I didn't get the operator's name or anything at the time, so it was just a random complaint probably. To be honest, I was more riled up at her behavior and unwillingness to even hear me out or help, than actually trying to get her in any kind of trouble. And I certainly didn't expect a response like that.</p>

                <h5>Involving the DOB</h5>
                <p>After seeing no improvements and the ineffectiveness of going over and politely requesting they turn the bass down, I begin filing 311 complaints more and more often until the end of the year in November. 
                <br><br>                
                Realizing the church might be illegally converted while researching how they were even allowed to build a church next door in the first place, I contacted the Department of Buildings (DOB) in October 2021 and reported the establishment for Illegal Conversion. This later resulted in them being fined and issued a partial vacate order in November 2021 for one year. The church received numerous violations and fines from the Department of Buildings and I believe this highlighted an underlying issue here. In which the church is technically, physically and actually using a “Residential Space as a Business”, which is illegal, but not on paper, since they were somehow able to file for it to be allowed with the DOB at a later date after the partial vacate order was issued.</p>

                <br><br> 
                On October 22, 2021, I contact MEND mediation via email in attempts to get a mediation with the church and explain to them our side of the story or show some kind of authorities what's going on.

                <h3>November 07, 2021</h3>
                <h5>The Weekend Morning Indonesian Group</h5>
                <p>A video in late 2021 before they were actually issued the vacate order, when I first really started feeling the need to document the issue. This video shows what me and my family actually went through EVERY Saturday and Sunday morning, and evenings on weekdays, for over a decade. However, when I returned home in 2021, they now had a different sound system or turned it up, and they played much much longer and still start as early as 7:30am.<br><br> I am using an app called "Sound Meter" which isn't as fully featured and detailed as the other apps I later discover. However, the app displays an estimated reading along with the audio from the video. It should clearly show how loud they are since the sound is recorded from inside my house with the windows initially closed.<br><br> The video starts off with the session already underway and with mostly the drumming and low frequency bass sounds, that are actually the trigger sounds that eventually led to my hearing and other health conditions. After about 3 minutes, you can hear only the drums still continue while the other instruments and fade out and come back at around 7 minutes to the end of the video. At around 22 minutes, you can also see me bring the phone to the window and you can also get an idea of how much sound is being emitted from the front of their property as well. You can also notice how the music is also almost none stop for the entire video, and that is just one segment of their session. <br><br>The decibel levels reach the high 60's in db(a) measured from inside my home, which means the db(C) which is weighted for the low frequency sounds you hear, should be a decent amount higher, and easily in the 70-80 db(C) range judging by how much louder the lower frequency sounds are here. <br><br></p>

                        <br><br>It's important to note that for these videos, you have to be wearing headphones or earbuds. A normal speaker from a tv, your phone or monitor, won't be able to play all the sounds as clearly and the bass sounds and lower frequency sounds wont be audible in the same way as if you were listening to it live. A pair of Samsung Buds or Apple Airpods should do. Decent high quality headphones such as Bose, or Sony should be even better and can actually provide spatial details on where the sound sources are coming from. The audio files however seem pretty clear enough for all devices, and have much higher quality audio playback.</p><br><br>

During this time, I was able to focus on really learning and expanding on the field of computer science, which I was denied the time to do when the church was open and during the actual live classes. I was also able to develop multiple business ideas and pursuits now that I understood the depths of my new field much more and was able to expand my skillset tremendously.</p><br><br>

                    <h5>Refreshers.</h5>
                    <p>In 2022, I picked up on multiple career building studies. I explored and built multiple programming projects with AI on various platforms and really started feeling passionate about my work and studies. I decided I didn't want to stop expanding my skills but needed a job where I could also look after my elderly parents and pets now with my little sister gone, and no one else to take care of them. I proceeded to brain storm and implement business ideas where I could work remotely or from home, which was the perfect place since I could take care of my elderly parents, pets and keep an eye on my aging grand uncle as well.</p>

                <h5>Soft Reopening</h5>
                <p>The church resumed activities in November 2022, holding 2-3 sessions between November and December before reopening fully in January 2023. I immediately noticed the noise hadn't improved, and after a few weeks I started filing 311 complaints, and calling the 110th precinct again by January 29, 2023.</p><br><br>

And if they know who I am, then how come the situation continued for so long or is this just how they handle these noise complaints. I was starting to feel stonewalled at every turn while requesting help from the authorities.</p>

                <h5>The disturbance returns, amplified.</h5>
                <p>In January 2023, the church fully reopened. I noticed in their soft reopening sessions late 2022, the music was still loud. However, I waited to see and give them some time to adjust it. 
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunately for us, the music actually got louder, as they attempted to announce their reopening to the neighborhood. After pretty much one month, starting January 29, 2023, I filed 311 complaints in regards to the noise they had each session.</p><br><br>

                    <p>I started documenting the noise using a decibel meter app on my phone, although it was limited to DBA readings. I start to feel concerned, and like I am going to require a more extensive approach towards documentation. It was already difficult enough to explain to authorities what was going on, let alone a judge in court who won't be able to come experience the issue first hand like the police officers could. I inform my uncle of the situation as he saw me talking to Cesar in front of our house. In March, I send Caesar a list of approved noise consultants from the DEP. Despite this, no significant soundproofing changes were made.</p>

                <h3>March 2023</h3>
                <h5>First Attempt of Noise Mitigation</h5>
                <p>I am in contact with Cesar and he calls me over to discuss their plans of mitigating the sounds. He mentions they are considering soundproofing and I agree this is a good decision and he should get a sound consultant and experts. On March 2, 2023, I send Cesar a list of sound consultants approved by the DEP from the government website list. I have documented this conversation with phone records in the form of text messages and email.
                <br><br>
                Through the following weeks, no soundproofing measures are taken on a construction level. When asked, they stated they moved around the speakers and added a sound absorbant pad for drums. However, on my side there was no difference in the sound levels, only in the balance of the sounds. 
                <br><br>
                Eventually by late April, the noise really hasn't changed, and it seems all they've done was move the speakers around. There was no real mitigation tactics in regards to real soundproofing in place for the level of sound they were producing from a fully equipped live band with speakers, and a choir, from a source that's very close in proximity. I remained patient as I understood soundproofing is costly. However, since there was no difference and the sound always reverted back to being loud, I questioned whether they were stalling to buy time. Which I understood again, how expensive these things could be, but felt they could've at the very least turned down the music or found other ways in the meantime.</p>

                <h3>April 2023</h3>
                <h5>April 11 - 14 Another NYPD Notice</h5>
                <p>After filing 311 complaints for months, I received information to contact the neighborhood coordinator from the 110th precinct named Officer Fuentes. I contact Officer Fuentes for the first time, and he sets up a visit to come witness the noise first hand on a Friday night. The officer witnesses the disturbance first hand and tells me there isn't anything he can do. He states he can let the church know someone complained. I inform please do so, and they most likely already know it's us, so confidentiality isn't an issue for us here. He proceeds to inform the church and him and his partner give me their card and leave.</p><br><br>
                <br><span class="show-more">Read More</span>
                <div class="details">
                    <h5>NYPD First hand witnesses</h5>
                    <p>It's important to note, Officer Fuentes and his partner arrived to the scene with a marked SUV and parks right in front of the church and my house in our shared driveway. The officer walks right into their building, and I had to call out to let him know I was the one who called him. 
                    <br><br>
                    The church obviously startled by the police arriving, played much quieter than usual, however it was still pretty excessive enough to where the officers acknowledged they could hear the instruments and choir singing clearly and at a conversational level.
                    <br><br>    
                    Officer Fuentes informs me he will inform the church and issue them a verbal warning, but also informs me that, basically, he can't do anything about it other than let them know someone complained, as in he can't force them to get soundproofing or any other mitigation tactics really. I inform him it's okay, and they most likely know it's us as I visited them in private first on a few occasions before. I ask if the Officer has sound meters so maybe we can get some readings. He lets me know me they do have sound meters but they're being used for noisy cars in the park and there weren't that many available for him to use or go around. I asked him what he thought I should do then.
                    <br><br>
                    Officer Fuentes and his partner's suggestion was that I should move or sue the church. I let him know that really wasn't something I was ready to do to a long time neighbor yet and after my family living there for almost 30 years. He then mentions I could try the community board then or contacting the DEP somehow. I take his advice and begin researching those government agencies.</p>

                <p>I follow Officer Fuentes's instructions and try to contact the DEP. After repeatedly calling multiple 311 agents to get an answer, I finally get a 311 agent who I believe was able to get me in touch with a DEP inspector, Inspector Reynoso after finding out you can request a correspondence or contact request. I requested an inspection of the church and scheduled it for the middle of May.</p>

Inspector Reynoso, had just informed me he'll get back to me when he returns from vacation so I refrain from mentioning anything to the other inspector since I obviously want an inspection and was confused by receiving mixed information.

                <h3>May 7, 2023</h3>
                <h5>Videos of Sunday, May 7, 2023 for the Church</h5>
                <p>The videos include a recording in May of 2023 of a Sunday afternoon session which started at 9am. The first video is of a 9am drumming session, and what I would hear every Sunday starting 2023. Although it isn't painfully loud, it is audible, and continues for a considerable amount of time. Long enough to wake you up as your survival senses and responses kick in while you are sleeping. 
                <br><br>
                This would go on for about 30 - 45 minutes for their morning session. The recording is a video with audio taken on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 capturing a sound meter app I am using on my tablet. The location is in my room on a small table.
                <br><br>
                The second video is a continuation and later in the session, at 2pm. This is live session with the choir and all the equipment turned on, the background sound is my TV in the living room due to the door in my room being open. You can hear the drums and bass are the most prominent and create warping sounds in the room from the reverberation at times. At approximately 7 minutes and 20 seconds in, you can hear the bass buzzing and this is another one of the harmful trigger sounds which has led to my hearing conditions. Towards the end of the video, I take the recording out into my living room and where you can still hear their music, basically stretching from one side of my house to the other. This is what I mean by I have no escape from the low frequency sounds and pounding of the drumming sounds, no matter where I am in my house. My TV is on in the background as a reference on how loud the drumming is.
                <br><br>
                These two videos are a good example of the particular sounds which I was exposed to on almost a daily basis, for very lengthy sessions spanning 6-8 hours a day, and 10+ hours on holidays where the church is open from dawn until 10pm or 2am on New Years. These are the sounds I had to study through, work through, sleep through and essentially live my life around.

                <h3>May 2023</h3>
                <h5>First DEP Inspection</h5>
                <p>DEP Inspector Reynoso returned from vacation and scheduled a Friday evening inspection. Before the inspection, I gave clear instructions not to enter the church or alert them to his presence. I reiterated this on the day of the inspection, but despite that, he walked right into the church, flashed his badge, and I had to call out to him.
                <br><br>

                This was problematic because, if you’re inspecting noise levels, you shouldn’t warn the source beforehand. Regardless, the music was so loud that he measured it as over the legal limit using a dB(A) weighted scale. I believe a bass measurement using db(C) would have shown them to be even more excessive.
                <br><br>
                    
                During the inspection, Inspector Reynoso commented that his own apartment was louder, which felt biased since he's supposed to enforce the noise code based on legal limits, not personal comparisons. The church was clearly in violation. However, his partner was much more empathetic to what me and my mom were going through, but I believe he was there more to shadow the inspector while still training.
                <br><br>
                    
                Inspector Reynoso then informed me he couldn’t fine the church as he had "no jurisdiction" but agreed he would warn them. He let's me know to just contact him again if anything though, but provides no clear way to do so as well as pretty much just telling me he can't really help me anyway.
                <br><br>

                    <p>After Inspector Reynoso's visit, I receive an email from a MEND coordinator which now informs me the church has responded to the mediation request and has agreed to enter into mediation. I sign the MEND "Consent to Mediate" form and email the document to Sharon Osbourne on May 12, 2023.<br><br>
                    Later, during mediation, the church confirmed they received a warning but were also told by the DEP Inspector that he couldn't issue them fines, which in my opinion, allowed them to continue their activities with hardly any adjustments.<br><br>

                <h5>Mediation & Intensity Increasing</h5>
                <p>During mediation, the church made minor adjustments, such as moving speakers around and adding a padding under the drums, but no significant soundproofing was done. On June 18-19, I sent a second email to Caesar, informing him that none of the changes were effective and let him know which specific key factors that were still an issue. I then let him know in order for us to proceed through the mediation, we would have to see some actual changes in the sound level. The church was still unable to make any meaningful adjustments.
                <br><br>    
                Around the same time, the bar across the street changed management and began playing extremely loud music especially afterhours, further exacerbating the noise issue and the length of my exposure to low frequency and instrusive sounds. I begin to start filing 311 complaints more often for the Soneros Bar, now that I start dealing with an excessive amount of low frequency bass noise and music all the time. I begin to lose sleep as sleeping at night doesnt become an option and sleeping in the day is limited to the ambient noise levels of that day, which can vary throughout the week.

                    <h5>A barrage of constant low frequency sounds</h5>
                    <p>I believe this is also around the time my aunt-in-law also began using her sewing machine more frequently, running it for hours throughout the day, adding to the daily noise burden. The church continued holding practice sessions during the day, sometimes starting at 3 p.m. and lasting several hours, overlapping with both the bar’s noise and my aunt’s sewing. The situation worsened with random drumming from the church and late-night sessions that frequently went past the 10 p.m. limit set by the city noise codes.
                    <br><br>
                    My health begins to suffer tremendously. I begin gaining weight as I am unable to keep on a consistent healthy schedule with diet, exercise or normal sleep and rest. I begin to develop a lot of anxiety now when hearing bass sounds or drumming sounds, due to trying to deal with studying or simply doing things peacefully in my home without being suddenly disturbed randomly by a loud drumming from the music class in session next door, or a random sewing machine constraining my brain positioned right above my head for hours, while knowing I also have a limited amount of time in the day before the church sessions in the evening, and before I get disrupted by the bar's music all night until 4am. 
                    <br><br>
                    Any other activities that suddenly arise such as helping my elderly parents with things in their daily life as well, now become an even heavier burden than it should, as my time is now being limited more and more, leaving me less and less of a time frame of the time I can properly use my home. My mother continues to be disturbed and is essentially forced to live around the church's schedule as well with how disruptive they are in her room. My father has recovered from his health conditions to an extent where he was able to return to work and isn't as exposed to the harmful sound conditions as me and my mom.

                <h3>Summer 2023</h3>
                <h5>An Unsuccessful Mediation</h5>
                <p>Despite the mediation process, the church continued to hold loud sessions and was unable to address the bass issue whatsoever. Despite continued efforts to communicate and find a solution, the church remained noncompliant, and the mediation process ended without resolution on July 12, 2023 after I felt they were just stalling or really had no idea how to resolve the issue.

                    <p>I informed the MEND mediation team that mediation was no longer effective, as the church wasn’t making any progress with the efforts made so far. I email Cesar as well and let him know of the situation. 
                    <br><br>
                    I send the church 3 letters via certified mail to ensure they sign for the letter. The letter is from myself, my mom, and my uncle(landlord) and reiterates the entire situation again in detail letting them know that the issue has far exceeded our patience and without any progress. We are giving one final notice before proceeding with legal action if no progress or attempt of communication is made within two weeks. 
                    <br><br>
                    Essentially I was making one last effort in saying, please just simply turn down the music while you attempt to fix this issue properly.

                <h3>August & September 2023</h3>
                <h5>An Unsuccessful Mediation</h5>
                <p>The church continued with no significant changes, only resorting to changing their schedule around slightly with a few less practices, that is until mid September when they just began to revert back to sound levels similar to before, and then gradually, with even lengthier sessions now with the holiday season approaching.

                    <h5>Starting to take real action</h5>
                    <p>I begin to tell my uncle that we will have to get someone to come measure the sound and take them to court if necessary. He agrees but asks me to go find a sound expert. I find Alan Fierstein from Acousticlog who gave an estimate starting at $8000 which included a month long recording where he sets up tamperproof equipment or $5000 for one session which includes an approximately one hour recording session and analysis. He also provides further advice on how to proceed with the situation I was in through legal channels. However, he lets me know there's no guarantee the results would win us anything in court of course.
                    <br><br>    
                    I relay this information to my uncle and it seems he doesn't want to take the risk in court for such a huge amount of money. I proceed to find another sound expert and received an estimate from New York Soundproofing for $900 an hour and a quick analysis, which seemed a little less thorough than Acousticlog's, but I informed my uncle and he again seemed hesitant to take the risk for that amount of money as well, being that it's just one hour recording and one chance to catch the church.

                <h5>Video of October 2023 for the Church & the Bar</h5>
                <p>

                    I contact a David Smith from Sound Testimony, another sound expert in the Pennsylvania region, who helped and recommended I can purchase a few pieces of equipment and record the nuisance myself daily. He believed that would possibly be a decent viable option, that I may be able to bring to court as opposed to getting him to come up and do sound readings. 
                    <br><br>
                    He can then do a bit of digital forensics work and verify the sounds with a report. I proceed to purchase the necessary equipment and step up the recording to more than a phone and tablet app. 
                    <br><br>
                    I add a good quality audio recorder and 2 sound meters, one I already had for dbA readings and one which is able to log data and measure low frequency sounds better using db(C) weighting. I also purchase a REED Instruments Sound Level Calibrator which ensures all my devices are calibrated properly before taking measurements each time. 
                    <br><br>
                    I begin figuring out how to take proper readings and document the process systematically. It was a learning process, however the consistency and quality of the recordings gradually increase. The recordings were required so frequently though, it was hard to manage time to do other things, such as study, pursue work and career efforts, or even listen to what was being recorded which made it more difficult to get better readings right away. That, along with keeping track of all the data, and along with managing other normal everyday life activities made the entire situation messy and unnecessarily unmanageable.
                    <br><br>
                    I begin feeling the frequency of tinnitus increase.

                <h3>November 2023</h3>
                <h5>Into the Holiday Season</h5>
                <p>
                    Prior to Halloween and into the holiday season, all 3 parties began exhibiting excessive behavior non-stop and worsens my anxiety. I start considering seeing a therapist from the mental fatigue and headaches I was feeling, and from dealing with the noise, particularly low frequency bass sounds. And at some point during November, or December, I mention this to my doctor and he gives me a referral for a therapist.                 
                <br><br>
                I also began filing more frequent 311 reports against the bar in attempts to stop the noise since September, and even more in November since a 311 agent told me that if you file enough reports, the community board members review the reports at the end of each month and may take notice and take action. 
                <br><br>
                Meanwhile I confront my uncle again about my aunt-in-law's sewing and he shuts me down quickly and insists she doesn't really have to sew and only sews sometimes for their grand children. I get a sense he doesn't want to deal with having to ask her to stop. I mention maybe I can buy anti-vibration pads? He reiterates she doesn't have to sew and changes the subject. 
                <br><br>
                Juggling multiple noise issues, from multiple sources already, I focus on having him help me resolve the church issue first and decide not to press on the sewing machine further for the time being. 
                <br><br>
                I also inform him of the bar issue and that I've been filing 311 reports tryin to get them to stop. He informs me he knows the bar owner and sees him around sometimes, but doesn't say much after that. I let him know I've been reporting them to the police for being excessively loud. He agrees and says they are excessive and the sound reaches upstairs and my aunt-in-law can't sleep as well. 
                <br><br>
                I figure the bar is clearly excessive and the police certainly do have some kind of jurisdiction over them, and that eventually filing these reports will reach the right officer on duty and he will do the right thing, which is give them a ticket and deter them from continuing the excessive behavior. However, all noises and sounds continue and even ramps up more and more, as it got deeper into the holiday season.

                <h3>December 2023</h3>
                <h5>Storms of Sound</h5>
                <p>The sounds start becoming unbearable, and extremely excessive and lengthy to an even further extent and degree from all sources. I continue filing complaints every night I can't sleep for the entire night hoping to get police to respond or even just show up. I call the precinct and receive the same responses, as in they'll send someone out. Sometimes they do, sometimes it's too late, sometimes they just make a phone call I believe. Either way, the music always resumes, and at some point late December, the bar begins using different tactics now to avert the police responses.                     
                <br><br>
                My aunt-in-law continues to sew at the same rate, pretty much everyday, during the afternoon into the evening. The church is now holding very lengthy sessions everyday of the week, sometimes up to 8 hours a day if there's a evening session, multiple days a week, with music practice or holdings classes as early as 3pm. 
                <br><br>
                They also have random gatherings for birthdays and other small events and allow the patrons to use the venue for private events, with the full sound system speakers, including the live band instruments. 
                <br><br>
                At this point, I am experiencing all 3 parties producing an abundance of low frequency sounds at excessive levels almost 16-18 hours a day, everyday. The sewing in the morning and daytime, overlapping into the evening and night with the church's daytime drumming practices or early evening music practice, and then late evening into night sessions all the way until 10pm and even past 10pm on some occasions. Then that's when the bar starts intensifying their music from 10pm until 4am, where I would finally get some quiet and be able to sleep before dealing with the same thing tomorrow morning in possibly as early as in 4 hours, cause maybe my aunt-in-law might start at 8am, sometimes 10am, it was very random at this time. The bar also blasts music when they open at 10:30AM for 15-20 minutes, everyday as well. I start getting concerned as I get tinnitus more often and more noticeably than before and consult my doctor about an specialist and also ask him for a referral for a therapist.

                <h3>January 2024</h3>
                <h5>Initial Medical Analysis</h5>
                <p>I see an ENT specialists, Dr. Allan Levin, who diagnosed me with tinnitus and referred me to audiologist Dr. Zarina Naizam. Who after some testing, assured me that my hearing was fine, but for me, the underlying problem of low-frequency exposure was still unresolved. 
                    <br><br> I would like to note here, months later, I compare her test results to another Doctor's and find that Dr. Zarina did not conduct a hearing threshold test "LDL", after I mentioned I had been exposed to loud bass noise and drum noises constantly. 
                <br><br>
                No hyperacusis was diagnosed at this point. After Dr. Zarina informed me my hearing was fine, I did not feel the need to continue any further visits to the Doctors, and felt somewhat relieved even though I was feeling symptoms of my tinnitus here and there, and thought my hearing issues were just possibly me experiencing temporary pain and effects from the church's NYE session. Dr. Naizam suggested I simply move if it's disturbing, but my hearing was fine. I didn't 100% agree, but decided to continue documenting the on-going situation.

                    <h5>Continued Nuisance & Difficulties of obtaining evidence</h5>
                    <p>I continued recording the noise nuisance from both the bar and the church. Since the bar started its noise issues later than the church, I had less data on the establishment, so I had to now focus on gathering evidence for both.
                    <br><br>    
                    By this point, I was extremely frustrated with the police for their lack of action. At this stage, I couldn't even coordinate with DEP inspectors to properly investigate the bar, because the bar had caught on to the police's visits and began playing music at random times—alternating between being excessively loud and quiet. This left me in a position where I had to guess when they'd play loudly.
                    <br><br>
                    The one-hour inspection window offered by the DEP in 1 - 2 months from now and scheduled before the times they're most excessive after 1am, just wasn't enough to catch them at their noisiest times, let alone display the full extent of their nuisance, especially on weekends, when the noise wasn't always consistent. This made it incredibly difficult to gather the necessary evidence for violations initially as well.

                <p>I began filing complaints with the community board about the police's failure to address the noise issue with the bar, despite my numerous 311 complaints. I detailed how I'd been documenting everything, but no real action was taken. I'm unsure if I mentioned the church at this time, but I definitely raised concerns about the bar.

                    <h5>Preparing further for legal action</h5>
                    <p>I told my uncle that I had gathered enough evidence, and I reached out to David Smith again, who had been helping me a little with the methods and devices I should use for a digital forensics report on the sound level data I collected. 
                    <br><br>
                    Around February/March 2024, I contacted him to further pursue this method, while also looking for a third-party inspection to get official readings to use in court, especially against the church and potentially the bar (though I was still hoping to resolve things with the bar without legal action). 
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout this time, I continued documenting everything as I was still getting tinnitus attacks more and more frequently now.

                <h3>March 2024</h3>
                <h5>The Second DEP Visit</h5>
                <p> I contacted the DEP again, trying to re-engage them after failing to get third-party sound measurements from Officer Fuentes. The noise from the church remained a major problem. Officer Fuentes tells me he has to check with his captain for the third party sound meter reading request. He then responds with a bit jumbled text that I believe stated they don't do that. However I do end up getting a DEP inspection again and two inspectors visited my house. This time they didn't mention anything about jurisdiction. 
                <br><br>
                The inspectors find the church extremely excessive and we have our conversation documented on audio recordings, sound meter data logs and video prior to the inspectors arriving taken from my phone. They are amazed at how excessive the church is and mention they've never seen anything set up like this before. The inspectors find the church well over the limit and go over and issue the church multiple violations and take pictures of their set up. Almost 20 minutes after it appears the inspectors leave their establishment, the church's music comes right back on again still at an excessive level. 
                <br><br>
                This is a systemic issue, being they literally just got issued a summons, and turned around and continued to commit the very same violation immediately after. They essentially didn't make any attempts to even lower the noise the following weeks afterwards. Keeping in mind, they have already been notified of the issue. This would continue all the way until months later, where on May 6th, Cesar randomly texts me one morning to tell me if I hear loud construction noises, they're working on soundproofing on the walls. By the time he texted they were already well into the job, and there was zero advance notices or any permits outside on the building.

                <h5>The nuisance continues...</h5>
                <p> Despite receiving several violations from the DEP, the church's noise mitigation efforts were minimal, with the sound levels hardly changing. This was an issue of heavy bass and bass drums, and the level of expertise required to mitigate such sounds. 
                <br><br>
                My aunt continues to sew daily, and the bar is still exhibiting the same excessive behavior. However I am now focused on the church, as I feel if I can start fixing the issues one by one, it should be easier to handle between managing other aspects in my daily everyday life, such as work and personal projects along with caring for my elderly parents and pets. 
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately at this point, my health has suffered to a considerable degree from the inability to keep on a regular healthy schedule. I gain 20-25 lbs in those last few months, and even more later on. 
                <br><br>
                After the DEP visit, I am hopeful the issue is finally going to be resolved, and relent on documenting a bit.

                <h5>The nuisance continues...</h5>
                <p>
                    I believe this occurred in May or March. My documentation says May, however I may have filed an earlier complaint via 311. But after filing numerous 311 complaints to no avail for the noise, with the police randomly checking off boxes with they took action or they found no evidence for months now, I decide to just file a complaint with the CCRB and the IAB. 
                    <br><Br>
                    This actually prompts a call from the precinct within next few days and someone reaches out to me to inquire about the situation. They recommend I speak to the neighborhood coordinator and I explain I have already spoke with him and he told me he couldn't do anything, but I will try again.
                    <br><br>
                    Within the next few weeks, the neighborhood coordinator calls me in attempts to follow up. By this time, I already acquired another inspection

                <h3>May 2024</h3>
                <h5>A pattern of chronic non-compliance and reckless disregard</h5> 
                <p>
                On May 6th, 2023, after an hour or two of hearing heavy construction sounds in the morning, Cesar texts me and lets me know if I hear construction noise, they're planning on doing some soundproofing.
                <br><br>
                The church attempts to install soundproofing, and Cesar calls me over to assure me something is being done and to have a look. I am ofcourse relieved they are finally taking meaningful steps to mitigate the disturbance after over a decade and was invited over to the church to check out the soundproofing. 
                <br><br>
                I see a construction professional and a patron of the church I always see, working on the wall we share. They appear to be adding another layer to the wall, with some fuzzy soundproofing material, and then another wall they informed me I believed called "QuietRock" on top of that, which is a type of soundproofing wall, both layers over the existing layer and with the HVAC between those walls still. I noticed the soundproofing didn't extend all the way to the end towards the front of the house, as my room on my side does, but on their side it's their main entrance/foyer for guests, for the event space on the first floor. After this observation, I ask them do they plan on completing the work all the way to the end here? They asked me why and said they weren't planning on doing it, but since I mentioned it was my bedroom, they would ask the pastor. 
                <br><br>
                My thoughts here were, if you're planning on doing soundproofing, you would most likely need to seal off the entire wall, but I was no expert and I just requested they please do so.(Afterwards, I am uncertain if they listened or did the work properly, because the whole time I believed I could clearly hear a sound difference in that section of the wall and room, which is about 30% of my room).
                <br><br>
                Regardless, I believe this resulted in an increase in low-frequency sounds reverberating, being trapped, or amplifying inside our house. I am uncertain how to describe it specifically, but it sounded like living in a wind tunnel with unusual sounds. This is when I started noticing the strange headaches, ears popping, tinnitus attacks and faster heartbeat.
                <br><br>
                During this time, I believe this is when the Hyperacusis began to really set in and get to a point of no return and I was experiencing all the symptoms I mentioned at the highest levels.
                <br><br>
                In duration of a week or two while they were doing their construction, the sound in my house changed without me noticing the harmful effects. I was not able to pinpoint what it was at the time, however my ears started popping a lot, then I would get tinnitus attacks, followed by cloudy and painful headaches and then extreme dizziness and nausea, and after awhile, full on vertigo. 
                <br><br>
                I started to begin feeling my cognitive abilities and mental health were being affected now too, as the headaches were strange, and constricting and only in certain parts of the brain sometimes. I felt my chest tightening up, and started to get chest or heart pains along with strange muscle tightness in my chest and underarm area. I would always wake up in a rush or panic feeling my heart racing. It wasn't only stressful but the strange mental fatigue I was experiencing felt like it was preventing me from carrying out any difficult cognitive tasks and pursuing any sort of relief or help. I would feel constantly sick and nauseous even after taking medication to alleviate the nausea. Absolutely nothing helped.
                <br><br>
                After the two weeks the church worked on the soundproofing along the wall we share, the pastor's son Julian, along with the church patron(not the construction guy or contractor) who was working on the wall came over to check out the sound levels before an evening session began. 
                <br><br>
                I mention to him the entire situation of how me and my mother have been feeling sick and that I believe it's caused by the way the soundproofing was installed. I informed him I was hearing strange low frequency sounds and vibrations possibly from the HVAC being attached along the soundproof wall, which is now trapped in between the layer of soundproof walls and materials, over the existing drywall. 
                <br><br>
                He replied, he believes I have sensitive hearing, and there wasn't anything wrong with their installation. I pointed out they have a huge central air unit sitting visibly on the back of the roof, and he along with the other gentleman dismiss my claim. 
                <br><br>
                I let him know again, to come check out the bass sounds to make sure the soundproofing works properly, since they weren't playing the drums on this occassion. I also let them know that if I do find that the soundproofing is making me sick, I am going to have to take it seriously and we'll have to go through court. To which he replied was fine implying the work was done properly. 
                <br><br>
                I see Julian one more time in a day or two, and ask if he's going to come check out the sounds again, because the bass is still loud. Unfortunately, he replys with "we'll see". This was an issue because, it felt like they weren't really taking my concerns very seriously at all anymore and they felt like they've done their due diligence and completed the work, but me and my mother were already beginning to experience health symptoms and they were worsening.
                <br><br>
                Luckily, with my mother not being exposed to the bar or the sewing machine as much, her symptoms aren't as drastic and serious as mine yet. To be honest, I also feel because sees how bad my symptoms are affecting me, she doesn't want to add any additional burden onto the family as well. 
                <br><br>
                After informing Julian and the Church representative when they visited about me and my mother feeling sick and the soundproofing being improperly installed. I email Cesar again and attempt to describe what I'm hearing on my end, and mention the sound is actually worse in strange ways. At this point, I inform him for the last time that I suggest he hire a sound consultant/expert. 
                   
                <h5>The Journey for Medical Treatment Begins</h5>
                <p> 
                This is when I started reaching out to my doctors again and let them know what I was experiencing. In the following months, I first returned to Dr. Alan Levin where he diagnosed me with "acoustic phonotrauma" and suggested I research and get a second opinion from another expert. In June, I visited a Dr. Stephen Warman, and an Audiologist named Vasilia Meskouris. Dr. Warman diagnoses me with hyperacusis along with tinnitus and minor physical ear congestion and Dr. Meskouris mentions my hearing threshold is lower than most people my age. Dr. Warman refers me to see Dr. Sean Mcmenomey at NYU Langone for a further diagnosis and to seek treatment and Dr. Meskouris recommends I reach out to a Dr. Susan Adams. I proceed do so as soon as possible, with the NYU doctor first. 
                <br><br>
                Dr. Mcmenomey confirms my conditions further, provides more insight and refers me to the Center for Hearing with Dr. Susan Adams.
                <br><br>
                I reach out to the center and they provide some information in regards to a possible treatment to the tune of $5500 to start, with no guarantees and an 80% success rate. 
                <br><br>
                As I am technically unemployed, I hold off and just focus on trying to be able to find ways to manage the condition to where I can somewhat recover, get some kind of means of sustainable consistent work and move away, and just try to get better in other ways first somehow. 
                <br><br>
                However, this proved to be extremely difficult and I experience a bit of shock and a lot of uncertainty. This leads me to having to isolate myself more and more often. At this point, I am extremely frustrated and file complaints to the DEP commissioners office again. This prompts the DEP to send Inspector, first name Luis I believe, to my house to take a statement from me of the ongoing issues. He tells me he'll have an inspector call me soon.
                <br><br>
                It's important to note that I fully notified the Inspector Luis of my hearing issues and he is fully aware I was now seeing a doctor for these issues when taking his statement. He then proceeded to walk around outside of the bar and inspect the space.
                <br><br>
                I also reached out to an Inspector Buffa as well, who is part of the DEP and he did call me back to leave me a message, but Inspector Luis came to the house a day or two after, and I didn't see the need to be in contact with multiple agents.

                <h3>June 2024</h3>
                <h5>A horrible realization</h5>
                <p> 
                I proceed and attempt to schedule two inspections when the inspector calls, one for the bar and one for the church with an Inspector Milazzo from the DEP 9th Unit. He informs me he's unable to schedule a church inspection until they go through their court date in July, and because they're so booked, the next appointment would be available in September. This is after I informed him I believed they're still at a violational sound level, and the issue wasn't fixed and possibly getting worse. 
                <br><br>
                He informs me he can't schedule anything for the church yet, so I let him know the situation with the bar, and how it will be tricky. I mentioned I wanted the inspection conducted on the street with inspector Luis earlier and assumed he would relay everything that was said in the 30 minutes he was at the house taking my report. 
                <br><br>
                However later, it appears there was a miscommunication, as the inspectors that arrived was not ready to conduct an inspection from the street.
                <br><br>
                This is when I spoke to the DEP again, informing them of the issue still persisting, however they inform me they can't do anything until the church has their court date for the initial summons. I then request an inspection for the bar. To which I explain the situation of how they try to hide and avoid inspections from the police currently. I let him know, for this reason, they resorted to playing after 2am the loudest because they know the police won't be able to respond by the time they close at 4am. They also turn the music up and down at random times and it varies with their playlist on certain days. Inspector Milazzo tells me he can only give me an inspection from 12am to 1am the latest, in a month from then on July 18. To which I just accept because there isn't a choice really, if I want any chance of relief. 
                <br><br>
                This did throw me off, as it seemed like I was reporting a crime being committed from 2 A.M. - 4 A.M. and the Inspector responded with well, we can send someone at 12 A.M. - 1 A.M.. It also seemed like they were asking me when is the best time, but at the same time, stating, we do have this time window but in 2 months from now, where a lot of harm and change could occur in the meantime. Essentially, I also felt like this also allowed for a lot of inconsistencies to be possible, as I couldn't really show the times establishment was excessive to the degree or extent they were actually being. I also felt like this is how a sound inspection should be conducted at the very least, with the element of surprise within a reasonable time frame. For example, if they just happen to be closed or not as loud on that day for whatever reason, I would have to go through the situation another 2 months, a total of 4 months now, before getting another visit. 
                <br><br>
                This is why I believe this process should offer more a more streamlined and transparent approach in a sense where you can just simply schedule these inspection appointments online like a DMV appointment or other appointments now available with other government agencies. The appointment should also be discrete and available upon request, not as if it's some special priviledge. The scheduled date and time of the appointment should only known to the Inspectors and system involved. This would prevent/deter favorable establishments from receiving biased inspection times and outcomes.

                    <h5>Increasing Health Decline</h5>
                    <p>My health and mental well-being worsened due to the ongoing noise issues. Despite medical evaluations and continued documentation of the noise, no substantial resolution was reached. The church's soundproofing is still improperly installed. And they were still extremely excessive without even noticing or caring enough to come back and even check if the sound was better.
                    <br><br>
                    Everyday began feeling worse and worse. And the hope of relief seemed to be getting further and further as I found out more and more about my condition. Not only was I now aware of the imminent health symptoms and conditions that were affecting me, but I was now informed it would be permanent and the sources that caused my conditions would still be continuing their excessive behavior into my home, while the condition was severe enough where I might not be able to have the ability to get away or even fight back.
                    <br><br>
                    Really, a feeling of knowing your inevitable demise and the decline of your health and being unable to do anything to stop it. There were times I did not know if I was just going to have to hear extremely loud and painful sounds for the rest of my life until I went crazy or just committed suicide to make it stop. Or even the matter of when and how long until this would happen. I felt I was on the brink of insanity every single day, and that was the main fight I would wake up to everyday until the end of the year.

                <h5>Nomadic Relief and Mitigation Tactics</h5>
                <p>The combination of noise from the church, the bar, and my aunt's sewing remained unrelenting. I continued to juggle personal and professional obligations, including business interests and family responsibilities, while pursuing solutions for the noise problem as my condition actually begins to get worse and worse. I resort into driving to parks or areas I believe are quiet enough. I learn a lot of areas are not as quiet as they seem. I start to understand the effects the low frequency sounds are having, and start researching about my condition more and more from my car using my phone and tablet. This was the only place I felt safe at the time, because I would be able to simply drive off if any dangerous sounds were present. For the next few months, I would only return home mostly after 4 A.M. or earlier on certain days, I felt sane and healthy enough to stay in my home and withstand or endure the pain, just enough to find ways to find relief or fight back little by little, one day at a time.

                <h3>August 2024</h3>
                <h5>Relentless sewing continues, despite multiple notices of harmful and health decline</h5>
                <p>Trying to find ways to manage the noise, I have to leave my house almost everyday due to my aunt's random sewing violently waking me up. After repeatedly telling her and my uncle about my condition, I cease my personal communication with them. My parents still talk to them as a way to stay amicable while we still live here and try to find better living arrangements. 
                <br><br>
                I resort to having to drive out to parts of eastern Queens, and eventually Long Island, and away from any traffic with as little people as possible in the daytime. 
                <br><br>
                The church attempted multiple ways to mitigate the sound, to no avail. The first contractor no longer shows up and I witness another team is brought in to 'fix' the soundproofing. They begin tearing down the old one completely, and making adjustments, which still aren't very satisfactory at all, and still leak in weird ways. The sound pressure in my house is still weird and I still feel extreme symptoms at home. However, now I am a little bit more unsure if they are from the soundproofing or just the nature of my condition and symptoms.

                <h3>September 2024</h3>
                <h5>My condition worsens, and I experience new physical symptoms.</h5>
                <p>My aunt continues to randomly sew everyday. The bar continues to play music from 10pm - 4am with excessive volume and bass. I begin trying to contact 311 and get the local police to stop them again, and go through the procedure to see if they would now able to stop the noise. 
                <br><br>
                I add a security camera to the front of my house facing the bar, now recording any interactions they may have if the police arrive, or with their late night activities of blasting music from their cars, fighting, yelling etc. This evidence is also synced up with how I do my usual audio, video, sound meter, sound app recordings on a few occasions as well. This should show a level of consistency. I begin documenting the noise from the bar more openly, and get sound readings closer to their establishment in hopes to obtain accurate sound readings and evidence of where the source of the sound is coming from. 
                <br><br>
                This does feel extremely uncomfortable, especially in a neighborhood full of people, where I have lived for decades. And I can feel a sense of people wondering what I'm up to, or wondering why I might be acting strange. Regardless of the embarassment I feel at this point, I literally have no choice but to take these matters into my own hands before my own health gets worse or it starts taking a toll on my parents even more. So I try to document the issue relentlessly, but still try to maintain a level of respect for their business operation and be as quick and discrete as I can with the recordings. Mostly not to noticeable to customers and just look like I'm possibly just recording the environment. 
                <br><br>
                I continue trying to find ways to mitigate the noise. I begin to notice my condition worsening, however, I am still not sure what is exactly causing the symptoms, where these noises are all coming from, and how quiet does it have to be in order for me to exist without feeling sick or getting headaches. 
                <br><br>
                By the end of September I believe, I notice myself begin to burp excessively when being exposed to low frequency sounds, and I begin getting some chest pains, sharp pains under my arms again. I start feeling like my brain is being torn or warped as part of the headaches. Similar to the initial feelings when I first felt sick. This is horrible and lasts for as long as I'm exposed to low frequencies or whatever it is in my house. 
                <br><br>
                However, it does help me identify where the sounds are coming from more. I focus on trying to recover enough everyday to stay fully conscious(meaning more along the lines of maintaining some form of mental self awareness vs literally just being awake) and in a decent state of mind as long as possible. Sometimes I feel a little bit like the sounds are tearing my sanity apart from lack of sleep, and I can't fully recover fast enough before being exposed to low frequency noises or whatever it is that is making me feel horribly sick again. 
                </p>

                <div class="details">
                    <h5>Another attempt to fix the soundproofing</h5>
                    <p>
                        The church has made several adjustments to the soundproofing after most likely, witnessing me document their sound from my window sill on several occasions during their recent sessions, and possibly hearing me complain during my recordings as well as seeing me with hearing protection constantly now.
                        <br><br>
                        They hire another contractor or the second contractor continued his work and made further adjustments. Now the sound is much better when they play music, however the bass still leaks through excessively, and the weird sounds and issue with the HVAC still persist now in different ways still making me feel sick and giving me headaches. This clearly showed their soundproofing mitigation attempts were still unprofessional and not done properly or with expert consultation. 
                        <br><br>
                        I record the sound often throughout the day while I'm not home and may have the construction sounds of them tearing down the walls, and hammering away when building it up again. I do have a video of when that same team was painting the walls on the balcony and door frames from the outside of the church. They did this the same time while hammering the walls, maybe to hide the fact they were tryin to fix the soundproofing. This is why I do believe that the soundproofing was adjusted once again, cause I could clearly hear and feel hammering along our shared walls. They also had a table saw set up outside as well, clearly doing major construction activity with no permits or notice to us again what so ever. I also documented the issue and reported them for construction without permits, after the first or second day I was abruptly awaken by construction sounds.

                <h3>October 2024</h3>
                <h5></h5>
                <p>
                    Further research has me to believe that the condition is triggered by certain frequencies in which I have identified before. However, I can now see which ones affect me more and to what extent. This helps me manage the condition to an extent where I can start somewhat having some control of the recovery phase which happens during rest(but not always). 
                    <br><br>
                    Regardless and unfortunately, everyday I wake up with the condition in my current living space, I go through the same thing again and again. I begin with being horribly awaken at some point(or several points if I'm able to go back to sleep, and usually every 2 hours), with certain low frequency sounds under 200 mhz exceeding as low as 20 decibels, on it's own 1/3 octave band. Which doesn't take much, especially in the daytime. My aunt's sewing machine measures at 50-60 decibels on the 120hz 1/3 octave band instantly and constantly when powered on for reference. I then leave the house and try to find quiet areas depending on the day and time, I usually have to end up in areas and places very far from where I live, and further away from the city, traffic or people. I then return home after 4am, after the bar is closed, and try to study about my condition or work on related topics, eat, sleep, and essentially try to find my way out of this endless loop. 
                    <br><br>
                    In late October, I realized I really wasn't going to be able to stay sane long enough to find cheaper treatment or treatment on my own, let alone any ways to even get some relief.
                    <br><br>
                    <h5>Reaching out to Dr. Adams again</h5>
                    <br><br>
                    I reach out to Dr. Adams again and she replies on Oct 22nd, this time getting a hold of the doctor personally. I schedule a 15 minute phone consultation for the next day on the 23rd, but ends up actually being on the 25th.
                    <br><br>
                    This 15 minute phone consultation which actually turned out to be 30-40 minutes, was a huge difference and turning point of relief. Dr. Adams, was not only familiar with what I had been experiencing, but was able to explain to me and further diagnose me to an extent the other doctors weren't as specialized to do, due to the extreme rarity of the condition.  
                    <br><br>
                    She was able to give me a few mitigation tactics to help me cope but was unfortunately unable to treat me further and suggested my condition is even much more complicated than it appeared, and that I might also have other related conditions such as "misophonia".
                    <br><br> 
                    Dr. Adams refers me to another specialist in Connecticut she mentioned would be better suited to treat me, a Dr. Natan Bauman, a former Director of the Hearing, Speech, and Language Clinic at Yale New Haven Hospital now with his own private practice in the New Haven area.
                    <br><br>
                    I reach out to the doctor immediately and am able to get in touch with someone after some time. On November 11, 2024 the doctor's office returns my call/email and schedules me for an initial evaluation on November 20th, 2024.

                <h3>November 2024</h3>
                <h5>Finally, alittle bit more concrete hope.</h5>
                <p>

                    After reaching out to Dr. Bauman's office, I set up the earliest appointment in about 2-3 weeks on November 20th, for an initial evaluation and consultation. I noticed the office staff in general was much more familiar with my condition and felt a bit more hopeful after speaking with them.
                    <br><br>
                    <h5>The Initial Evaluation with Dr. Bauman. November 20th, 2024</h5>

                    I visit Dr.Bauman's office in Connecticut and after the initial hour evaluation, the doctor gives me a preliminary diagnosis of phonophobia along with the hyperacusis and tinnitus. He lets me know we would require further evaluation and testing on the next visit, but he did believe he may be able to help with treatment utilizing various tactics which include cognitive therapy along with specialized custom hearing devices.
                    <br><br>
                    After some consideration about managing the costs, I decide to take the next available appointment and start the testing and evaluation to begin treatment. 
                    <br><br>
                    The doctor informs me that he would like the equipment to be ready for the evaluation, and ofcourse I agree and we purchase the hardware to be ready to begin treatment as soon as possible, immediately after the evaluation. 
                    <br><br>
                    The next available appointment was on December 31, 2024, at 8:30 A.M. and I do everything I can to make sure I have everything necessary for the appointment and am able to make the appointment with no problem. This included booking a room at a hotel the day before and after the appointment to make sure I was able to travel with enough sleep due to the bar's late night activity ending at 4 A.M. everyday, even though December 30th, was a Monday, and the appointment was on December 31st. I was also lucky enough to find a hotel with soundproof rooms in the area.

                <p>

                Dr. Bauman conducts his testing and evaluation and I believe the technical hearing test results were able to show a great deal. He was able to measure my threshold for specific octave bands and help me identify the aspects we needed to work on with each specific triggering sound. 
                <br><br>
                The doctor programs the hearing devices and about four to five hours later, after a bit more testing and fitting, I should be more equipped to start making an attempt to regain my senses with the doctor and his team's help.

                <h5>January 1, 2025</h5>
                <p>

                    After leaving my home for a few days, I notice a drastic change in my health for the better. I felt I was able to breathe slightly better, my heart was beating normal, and my mind was more clear. The headaches subsided, and the burping stopped. Unfortunately, this didn't last for long.
                    <br><br>
                    This is further contrasted when I return home, and start feeling the symptoms I experienced before start coming back almost immediately. This pushes me to believe my suspicions with the faulty soundproofing and I start contacting the authorities again with the new information. I contact the D.E.P for strange sounds and for their music still being excessively loud, as well as the D.O.B for unapproved construction contrary to plans, as I realized if they didn't get a professional sound consulatant and I saw no permits outside on all those times they did construction, that they may have not followed proper building codes and construction procedures.
                    <br><br>
                    My aunt continues to sew randomly throughout the day despite being fully aware of the seriousness of my condition now. The bar also continues their excessive behavior during the afterhours all the way til 4:00 A.M. every day. The church's sound levels are still in violation, however I did notify the police to inform them of it, and I am currently waiting to see if the pattern will continue. I am also awaiting another DEP inspection for both parties, and hopefully to also discuss with the inspector the options I have with my aunt-in-law/landlady and her use of the industrial sewing machine. 
                    <br><br>
                    I continue to contact the authorities in regards to the situation with the bar and try to find a way to escalate the issue with the police due to the bar's aversion tactics, and DEP's difficulties with scheduling and availability. If anyone can give these guys a ticket to deter them or find evidence of the disturbance and nuisance, it should most likely be the authorities that are located about a few blocks away from the bar. However, this proves extremely difficult with only filing 311 reports and providing details through 311 channels or even calling the 110th Precinct.

                    <h5>More Systematic Failure | January 3, 2025</h5>
                    <p>

                        The officer's all have a variety of different responses, which essentially further deflects and actually just passes on the responsibility to other departments.
                        <br><br>
                        The officer's responses vary from things like: they are only able to give the bar a verbal warning, to yes we can give them tickets, to no we can't give them tickets, to call the DOB, call the community board, repeating things like, "we'll they're a commercial establishment and is allowed to play music", to which I replied, yes, but certainly not to excessive sound levels. An Officer Cazzo or Casso, from the 110th precinct iterated the same thing as well on a recent phone call. He seemed adamant the bar was not committing any crimes and they were not able to help with more than a verbal warning each time. I let him know it's not logical for the bar to be making the same excessive sounds, and sound levels as a car with a loud exhaust in violation, but not be able to receive tickets. He lets me know, well the car is passing by and goes away, to which I confirm as he just proved my point to himself? I let him know that, it's even worse when the source is stationary for 6-8 hours in front of your house every night then. I was confused there, and I pointed out the inconsistency. So again, the police appear to provide another excuse, reason, or explaination on behalf of the bar. 
                        <br><br>
                        He relinquishes a little and agrees. He then informs me I would have to just keep calling them each time the bar was excessive, which seemed like a complete failure to resolve an on-going issue. I mention it's not a crime but it must be some sort of violation. He puts me on hold for about 15 minutes, and I hear him pick up the phone a few times to see if I hung up. Eventually I simply call back and ask for a lieutenant.
                        <br><br>
                        The officer then quickly reassures me they are doing absolutely everything they can to resolve the issue. I push a little more and let him know that I'm already seeing a doctor for hearing conditions, I am looking to escalate the issue because it hasn't been resolved in over a year and going into 2 years now. I inform him I would like to speak to a higher ranking officer than the neighborhood coordinator, who they keep sending me to and I've spoken to on multiple occasions already. The officer denies me again and tries to change the subject away from escalating. Regardless, I could clearly see what was happening, and I decided to let him know this is a failure of the system and that I would be continuing to find ways to escalate the issue.
                        <br><br>
                        It's also important to mention I also made sure Officer Cazzo/Casso was aware I now have a hearing condition and have began seeing doctors. So I once again informed the authorities of the seriousness and urgency of the position I am in. 
                        <br><br>
                        A few days later, after emailing the DEP myself again, two days later on January 6, I receive an email from the DEP stating they've been contacted by the police department and would like to help set up an inspection. I filled out the form and await their call.

                <h5>January 13, 2025</h5>
                <p>

                    During the beginning and middle of the month, I file a complaints with the DOB trying to explain the full scope of the issue. They respond with a request for me to provide the addresses, and I do so. I file a follow up 311 complaint of unapproved construction plans or contrary to plans. As there's no exact section for "faulty soundproofing installed". 
                    <br><br>
                    The DOB 311 Service Request number for this is 311-21561512 on January 13, 2025.
                    <br><br>
                    I also filed a report with the police department requesting they inform the bar fully that the issue was specifically due to bass sounds once again. To make them aware of the specific issue, and reiterate what to address and ensure understanding.
                    <br><br>
                    Janaury 16, 2025. Approximately 11:00PM, I notice the some construction sounds from the church and see the Pastor bringing a ladder into the first floor space next door. I then hear drilling, hammering, etc on the wall we share. I document the incident as file a request for an update for an inspection on their faulty soundproofing. During the recording alittle bit later, my aunt-in-law also uses the sewing machine, which then creates mix of sounds.
                    
                    <br><br>

                    Jaunary 16, 2025. The DEP calls me at approximately 7PM and I speak with an inspector. I explain the situation to the inspector about the church's faulty soundproofing, which led me to develop a hearing condition and had to see doctors and it appears the ticket specifically went out to the DEP from the police as mentioned earlier I received an email. However, I didn't inform the police of the church until Sunday, in which I filed another 311 report.

                    <br><br>

                    The inspector mentioned since I filed that more recently and just a few days ago, I would have to wait for the next batch of sound inspection requests to be sent to them by the precinct/police, and said he receives these requests from the police in batches. He informs me he does have an appointment today for the bar tonight already set up for 11pm - 1am. I hear another inspector in the background say "is that Tony?", and then the inspector confirms the appointment again.

                    <br><br>

                    As we have been documenting the sound for awhile now, we can also see since I received the letter from the DEP, the bar's pattern this week have not only been quieter, but quieter more often than usual. I also mentioned in my 311 report to inform them specifically about the bass being an issue again. Meaning if the police officer relayed the message, the bar has again been made aware of the specific issue.

                    <br><br>

                    Last night, the bar actually waited until about 2 A.M. to turn up the music. Which I informed the inspector about, but he relays to me the staff only goes up to 1 A.M. in this city that never sleeps. I find this alittle inadequate of a response, although I also understand and get the sense that the number of inspectors available are limited, and may not want to work that late, so I hesitate on requesting special treatment.

                <h3>DEP INSPECTION</h3>
                <h5>January 16, 2025</h5>
                <p>

                    I am not fully aware of the sitaution with the DEP inspection for the bar yet, and am still awaiting to inquire about the results. I'm not certain if the inspector visited for sure, cause I couldn't physically check. However, the bar's music appeared to go through several changes that night in what sounded like testing sound levels or a demonstration of sound levels, with the end result after 1 A.M. or so, still loud. However the music genre did change from songs in abundance of floor bumping bass, with rapid intensity, to less rapid intensity and less floor thumping.
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunately, the sounds were still predominantly under the 200hz range. After recording them the night after on the January 17 - 18, they were still excessively loud on the recordings, but still without the rapid intensity bumping bass sounds dominating the entire night's musical genre, and only about 2-3 segments of the night.
                    <br><br>
                    On January 18 - 19, at 9PM so far, and it is starting the same way with some bass coming over at a lower volume since 7PM, vs the usual after 10pm sound levels for the moment.

                    As the hearing devices begin to help with some of the sounds. I begin to notice the a difference with sounds from inside my house compared to other places. So I now notified the DOB of this issue, along with the DEP, due to just not being sure who would I report something like this to, since the DEP handles the sounds, and environmental aspects, and prompted them to get soundproofing, but the DOB handles construction. Either way my goal once again, now that I had alittle bit more supporting evidence to be able to explain to the authorities, was to notify them of the issue in detail and let them know what effects are taking place so they may be able to figure something out and fix it or reduce the effects for the time being.
