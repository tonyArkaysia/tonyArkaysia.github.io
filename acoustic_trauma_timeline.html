                <h3>2008 - 2018</h3>
                <h5>A second church group utilizes the venue.</h5>
                <p>In approximately 2010 - 2012, an Indonesian church group is allowed to utilize the church venue, bringing live bands, drums, and significantly louder music. Early Sunday morning sessions (7-8 a.m.) became disruptive weekly. My family started filing 311 complaints and calling the precinct as the noise escalated, but the relief was only temporary if there was any at all. Within this duration, the church also underwent construction several times and extended the back of the church which now blocks our backyard, and what may be a violation and illegal extension. I believe they aren't properly zoned to have commercial space and this may need further proper research from an expert. Regardless, this allows them to install central air unit on that roof of the extension, as well as add a concert stage in the back of their first floor apartment, which they now converted into a commercial open event space equipped with a concert stage that's now located on the other side of my parents bedroom.</p>

                    <h5>2012 - 2018</h5>
                    <p>The music sessions get louder gradually, but they remain predictable (around 10-15 minutes per session, several scheduled times a week). Noise complaints are filed occasionally via phone to the 110th precinct or via 311, but they only result in short-term relief, with the noise recurring every few weeks and gradually reverting back to excessive levels. 
                        
                        <br><br>I have always questioned this issue with my uncle, but my mom states he or his son claimed they weren't able to do anything about the noise because the church might've had some government connections, as my uncle use to talk to an officer of the 110th precinct who attended the church often during their sessions. Regardless we questioned even if they were allowed to build there in the first place. From what I remember, I was much younger and didn't really know any better let alone anything about the laws and city codes. My mother was also much younger and was more active outdoors with my little sister growing up, as opposed to now, where she isn't very mobile, she's retired and resting at home more often, and this means can't get away from the church noise a lot of the times.</p>

                <h3>April 2021</h3>
                <h5>Huge Difference from before</h5>
                <p>After covid, I decided to move back home to pursue a career change while keeping a closer eye on my parents, after my dad was extremely sick and hospitalized from covid. I immediately noticed a significant increase in noise levels. It seemed the church introduces a full live band in a concert like event with amplifying equipment and loud microphones. The sessions last much longer (four to six hours vs 10-15 minutes). The new pastorâ€™s son, a music teacher, holds random music classes throughout the day, making the noise unpredictable and much more frequent.</p>
                <br><span class="show-more">Read More</span>
                <div class="details">
                    <p>Despite the disruptions, I focus on my Data/Programming Course and continue trying to pursue my studies and journey into computer science, however, the noise interferes with my evening classes (Tuesdays and Thursdays) and the church's sessions are held at the exact same time as classes are scheduled at 7:00pm - 10:00pm. 

                        <br><br>My dad continues to struggle to rest and recover, my mom is exposed as frequently as I am, and is also closer to the source. She informs me its gotten bad to the point where her picture frames hung in her room have fallen off and broken at times. I begin thinking about and planning how to take my parents with me to California, and away from this. But in the meantime, I was going to speak with the church in case my parents wanted to stay in New York where all our family and friends are, and regardless to fix this ongoing issue that has now gotten much worse, for my parents, myself and my grand uncle if he has any other tenants move in after.</p>

                <h3>June 19, 2021</h3>
                <h5>A Tipping Point</h5>
                <p>My little sister passes away on a Saturday, and the noise from the church continues without any reprieve the next morning after her passing, and essentially almost the whole afternoon that Sunday. This adds to the family's grief and frustration, and causes me to hold off on taking any immediate further action for the time being. You can imagine the impact it has not being able to fully grieve after a loss like that in the family.</p>

                    And if my parents decide to stay here, I can't put this off anymore, especially if I'm going to leave, because there's no way any child would leave knowing their parents just have to continue living under these seriously unhealthy and really unlivable conditions.</p>

                <h3>July 2021</h3>
                <h5>First interaction with the church since returning home.</h5>
                <p>My first interaction with the church after a few months back and realizing they weren't going to quiet down. I was studying while the church was playing loud music, likely as part of a teaching session for Julian (the pastor's son) who holds music classes. The music was so loud that I had to yell just to get their attention. Julian and two students, including one in the control room, were present. Although already visibly upset, I asked them to turn down the volume. Julian responded that they would "try to turn it down," but there was no noticeable change after this at all. I give it some time in case they were planning to fix the issue.</p>

A tipping point for me in which I realized, they have been an mistreating my family for way too long and now have even ramped it up. And basically, I can't put this off anymore if I'm going to leave my parents in peace and continue on with my life if they decide to stay here.</p>

                <h5>NYPD Response from the local 110th Precinct. Officer Luis Motato</h5>
                <p>I called the precinct for some help to come resolve the noise issue. Officer Luis Motato of the 110th Precinct called me and helped notify them of our complaint.</p>

The officer and his team arrived after the church session had finished and informed the church of the issue and gave them an official notice a neighbor had complained about their noise. I mention to him it's fine if they know it's us, because I already spoke to them once before.</p>

                <h5>Second Interaction with the church.</h5>
                <p>I returned a second time and politely asked them to turn it down, now during the beginning of a full evening session. The new pastor(the old pastor's son) was dismissive, claiming the church is allowed to play music. Tony tried explaining that it wasnâ€™t about playing music, but the excessive volume and bass, mainly the drums and the bass. Cesar, the original pastor's son-in-law, stepped in to help translate(the pastor's english is very limited) but did not provide much input. The pastor again said they would "try to turn it down," but no change occurred after this interaction either. </p>

                    <p>I inform my uncle/landlord of the situation and let him know what happened. I let him know they're much more excessive than before and that I will start filing 311 complaints and report them to the police. He encourages me to do so and states they shouldn't be allowed to continue to bother us and it has been so many years. I inform him that their establishment shouldn't even be allowed to build there it seems. He lets me know he's also suspicious of how they were able to get approved to build a church attached to us. He believes they might've found some loop holes or know some officials to be able to get approved. He mentions an officer of the 110th precinct use to be a patron of the church and they spoke a few times during the church sessions. I let him know he needs to get a lawyer to probably fight that case in court, but I'll look into it and see what I can find and if I can find some free consultation or help.</p>

                    <p>I was so upset at her response and how dismissive she was. It also didn't help how defensive of the church she was without even really letting me explain, which I felt wasn't even fair and showed biased. I basically attempted to explain to her the church was very loud. And she proceeded to tell me I filed a complaint with 311, however I didn't get the operator's name or anything at the time, so it was just a random complaint probably. To be honest, I was more riled up at her behaviour and unwillingness to even hear me out or help, than actually trying to get her in any kind of trouble. And I certainly didn't expect a response like that.</p>

                <h5>Involving the DOB</h5>
                <p>After seeing no improvements and the ineffectiveness of going over and politely requesting they turn the bass down, I begin filing 311 complaints more and more often until the end of the year in November. Realizing the church might be illegally converted while researching how they were even allowed to build a church next door in the first place, I contacted the Department of Buildings (DOB) in October 2021 and reported the establishment for Illegal Conversion. This resulted in them being fined and issued a partial vacate order in November 2021 for one year. The church received numerous violations and fines from the Department of Buildings.</p>

                <p>A video in late 2021 when I first really started feeling the need to document the issue. This video shows what me and my family actually went through EVERY Saturday and Sunday morning for over a decade. However, when I returned home in 2021, they now had a different sound system, and play much much longer but still start as early as 7:30am.<br><br> I am using an app simply called "Sound Meter" which isn't as fully featured and detailed as the other apps I later discover. However, the app displays an estimated reading along with the audio from the video, should clearly show how loud they are since the sound is recorded from inside my house with the windows initially closed.</p><br><br>

                <h5>Short, quiet, and productive year.</h5>
                <p>The year was mostly quiet due to the church stopping their operations until the end of the year. During this time, I was able to focus on really learning and expanding on the field of computer science, which I was denied the time to do when the church was open and during the actual live classes. I was also able develop multiple business ideas and pursuits now that I understood the depths of my new field much more and was able to expand my skillset tremendously.</p><br><br>

I explored and built multiple programming and projects with Ai on various platforms and really started feeling passionate about my work and studies. I decided I didn't want to stop expanding my skills but needed a job where I could also look after my elderly parents and pets now with my little sister gone, and no one else to take care of them. I proceeded to brain storm business ideas and how I could work remotely or from home, which was the perfect place since I could take care of my elderly parents, pets and keep an eye on my aging grand uncle as well, since his kids all moved out.</p>

And if they know who I am, then how come the situation continued for so long or this just how they handle these noise complaints.</p>

                <h5>The disturbance returns, amplified.</h5>
                <p>In January 2023, the church fully reopened. I noticed in their soft reopening sessions late 2022, the music was still loud. However, I waited to see and give them some time to adjust it. The music actually got louder, as they attempted to announce their reopening to the neighborhood. After pretty much one month, starting January 29, 2023, I filed 311 complaints in regards to the noise they had each session.</p><br><br>

                <h5>First Attempt of Noise Mitigation</h5>
                <p>I am in contact with Cesar and he calls me over to discuss their plans of mitigating the sounds. He mentions they are considering soundproofing and I agree this is a good decision and he should get a sound consultant. On March 2, 2023, I send Cesar a list of sound consultants approved by the DEP from the government website list. For this, I have phone records in the form of text messages and email. Through the following weeks, no soundproofing measures are taken on a construction level. When asked, they stated they moved around the speakers and added a sound absorbant pad for drums. However, on my side there was no difference in the sound levels, only in the balance of the sounds. Eventually by late April, the noise really hasn't changed, and it seems all they've done was move the speakers around. There was no real mitigation tactics in regards to real soundproofing in place for the level of sound they were producing from a fully equipped live band with speakers, and a choir. I remained patient as I understood soundproofing is costly. However, since there was no difference and the sound always reverted back to being loud, I questioned whether they were stalling to buy time.</p>

                <h5>April 11 - 14 Another NYPD Notice</h5>
                <p>After filing 311 complaints for months, I received information to contact the neighborhood coordinator from the 110th precinct. I contact Officer Fuentes for the first time, and he sets up a visit to come witness the noise first hand on a Friday night. The officer witnesses the disturbance first hand and tells me there isn't anything he can do. He states he can let the church someone complained. I inform please do so, and they most likely know it's us, so it's confidentiality isn't an issue for us. He proceeds to inform the church and him and his partner give me their card and leave.</p><br><br>

                    <h5>NYPD First hand witnesses</h5>
                    <p> It's important to note, Officer Fuentes and his partner arrived to the scene with a marked SUV and parks right in front of the church and my house in our shared driveway. The officer walks right into their building, and I had to call out to let him know I was the one who called him. 

                    The church obviously startled by the police arriving, play much quieter than usual, however it's still pretty excessive enough.
        
                    Officer Fuentes informs me he will inform the church and issue them a verbal warning, but informs me that basically, he can't do anything about it but let them know someone complained, and he can't force them to get soundproofing. I inform him it's okay, and they most likely know it's us as I visited them privated first on a few occasions before. I ask if the Officer has sound meters so maybe we can get some readings. He lets me know me they do have sound meters but they're being used for noisy cars in the park and there weren't that many availalble for him to use or go around. I asked him what he thought I should do.
                    
                    Officer Fuentes and his partner's suggestion was that I should move or sue the church. I let him know that really wasn't something I was ready to do to a long time neighbor yet. He then mentions I could try the community board or contacting the DEP somehow.</p>

                <h5>Videos of Sunday, May 7, 2023 for the Church</h5>
                <p>The videos includes a recording in May of 2023 of a Sunday afternoon session which started at 9am. The first video is of a 9am drumming session, and what I would hear every Sunday starting 2023. Although it isn't painfully loud, it is audible, and continous and constant. 
                    
                    This would go on for about 30 - 45 minutes for their morning session. The recording is a video with audio taken on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 capturing a sound meter app I am using on my tablet. The location is in my room on a small table.<br><br>

                    The second video is continuing later in the session at 2pm. This is live session with the choir and all the equipment turned on. Towards the end of the video, I take the recording out into my living room and where you can still hear their music, basically stretching from one side of my house to the other. This is what I mean by I have no escape from the sound no matter where I am in my house.

                <h3>May 2023</h3>
                <h5>First DEP Inspection</h5>
                <p>DEP Inspector Reynoso returned from vacation and scheduled a Friday evening inspection. Before the inspection, I gave clear instructions not to enter the church or alert them to his presence. I reiterated this on the day of the inspection, but despite that, he walked right into the church, flashed his badge, and I had to call out to him.<br><br>

                    This was problematic because, if youâ€™re inspecting noise levels, you shouldnâ€™t warn the source beforehand. Regardless, the music was so loud that he measured it as over the legal limit using a dB(A) weighted scale. I believe a bass measurement using db(C) would have shown even more excessive noise.<br><br>
                    
                    During the inspection, Inspector Reynoso commented that his own apartment was louder, which felt biased since he's supposed to enforce the noise code based on legal limits, not personal comparisons. The church was clearly in violation. However, his partner was much more empathetic to what me and my mom were going through, but I believe he was there more to shadow Inspector Reynoso while still training.<br><br>
                    
                    Inspector Reynoso then informed me he couldnâ€™t fine the church as he had "no jurisdiction" but agreed he would warn them. He let's me know to just contact him again if anything though, but provides no clear way to do so as well as pretty much just telling me he can't really help me anyway.<br><br>

                    <p>After Inspector Reynoso's visit, I receive an email from a MEND coordinator which now informs me the church has responded to the mediation request and has agreed to enter into mediation. I sign the MEND "Consent to Mediate" form and email the document to Sharon Osbourne on May 12, 2023.<br><br>
                    Later, during mediation, the church confirmed they received a warning but were also told by the DEP Inspector that he couldnâ€™t issue them fines, which in my opinion, allowed them to continue their activities with hardly any adjustments.<br><br>

                <h5>Mediation & Intensity Increasing</h5>
                <p>During mediation, the church made minor adjustments, such as moving speakers around and adding a padding under the drums, but no significant soundproofing was done. On June 18-19, I sent a second email to Caesar, informing him that none of the changes were effective and let him know which specific key factors that were still an issue. I then let him know in order for us to proceed through the mediation, we would have to see some actual changes in the sound level. The church was still unable to make any meaningful adjustments.
                <br><br>    
                Around the same time, the bar across the street changed management and began playing extremely loud music especially afterhours, further exacerbating the noise issue and the length of my exposure to low frequency sounds. I begin to start filing 311 complaints more often for the Soneros Bar, now that I start dealing with an excessive amount of low frequency bass noise and music all the time. I begin to lose sleep as sleeping at night doesnt become an option and sleeping in the day is limited to the ambient noise levels of that day, which can vary throughout the week.

                    <p>I believe this is also around the time my aunt-in-law also began using her sewing machine more frequently, running it for hours throughout the day, adding to the daily noise burden. The church continued holding practice sessions during the day, sometimes starting at 3 p.m. and lasting several hours, overlapping with both the barâ€™s noise and my auntâ€™s sewing. The situation worsened with random drumming from the church and late-night sessions that frequently went past the 10 p.m. limit set by the city noise codes.
                    <br><br>
                    My health begins to suffer tremendously and I begin gaining weight as I am unable to keep on a consistent healthy schedule with diet, excercise or normal sleep and rest. I begin to develop a lot of anxiety now when hearing bass sounds or drumming sounds, due to trying to deal with studying or simply doing things peacefully in my home without being suddenly disturbed randomly by a loud drumming from the music class in session next door, or a random sewing machine constraining my brain positioned right above my head, while knowing I also have a limited amount of time in the day before I get disrupted by the bar's music all night as well. Any other activities that suddenly arise such as helping my elderly parents with things in their daily life as well, now become an even heavier burden than it should, as my time is now being limited more and more, leaving me less and less of a time frame of time I can properly use my home.

                    <p>I begin to tell my uncle that we will have to get someone to come measure the sound and take them to court if necessary. He agrees but asks me to go find a sound expert. I find Alan Fierstein from Acousticlog who gave an estimate starting at $8000 which included a month long recording where he sets up tamperproof equipment or $5000 for one session which includes an approx one hour recording session and analysis. He also provides further advice on how to proceed with the situation I was in through legal channels. However, he lets me know there's no guarantee the results would win us anything in court ofcourse.
                    <br><br>    
                    I relay this information to my uncle and it seems he doesn't want to take the risk in court for such a huge amount of money. I proceed to find another sound expert and received an estimate from New York Soundproofing for $900 an hour and a quick analysis, which seemed a little less thorough than Acousticlog's, but I informed my uncle and he again seemed hesitant to take the risk for that amount of money as well, being that it's just one hour recording and one chance to catch the church.

                <p>The videos includes a recording in October of a church practice session on a Thursday. After no reply from them since July after sending the final letter of notice, they continued on in almost the same exact way, and eventually ramping it up towards Halloween and into the Holiday Season with additional practice sessions and lengthier services to the schedule. The practice sessions would usually be about an hour, however during the holiday season they stretched for approximately 4 hours, depending on if they had a service session that day.

                <h5>Video of October 2023 for the Church & the Bar</h5>
                <p>The first video includes an early recording in 2023 of when I first started using the db(C) sound meter in recordings. The recording is done in my parent's room on a Sunday session for the Church. 
                <br><br>
                    The Second video includes the Bar's sound levels recorded from inside my hallway and is comparable to what I would hear if my windows were open in my room just on the other side of the wall on the right side. The music levels represent how they play everyday from 10pm to 4am, non-stop, for 7 days a week.

                <h3>November 2023</h3>
                <h5>Into the Holiday Season</h5>
                <p>Prior to Halloween and into the holiday season, all 3 parties began exhibiting excessive behaviour non-stop and worsens my anxiety. I start considering seeing a therapist from the mental fatigue and headaches I was feeling, and from dealing with the noise, particularly low frequency bass sounds.                     
                <br><br>
                I also began filing more frequent 311 reports against the bar in attempts to stop the noise since September, and even more in November since a 311 agent told me that if you file enough reports, the community board members review the reports at the end of each month and may take notice and take action. 
                <br><br>
                Meanwhile I confront my uncle again about my aunt-in-law's sewing and he shuts me down quickly and insists she doesnt really have to sew and only sews sometimes for their grand children. I get a sense he doesn't want to deal with having to ask her to stop. I mention maybe I can buy anti-vibration pads? He reiterates she doesnt have to sew and changes the subject. Juggling multiple noise issues, from multiple sources already, I focus on having him help me resolve the church issue first and decide not to press on the sewing machine further for the time being. I also inform him of the bar issue and that I've been filing 311 reports tryin to get them to stop. He informs me he knows the bar owner and sees him around sometimes, but doesnt say much after that. I let him know I've been reporting them to the police for being excessively loud. He agrees and says they are excessive and the sound reaches upstairs and my aunt-in-law can't sleep as well. I figure the bar is clearly excessive and the police certainly do have some kind of jurisdiction over them, and that eventually filing these reports will reach the right officer on duty and he will do the right thing, which is give them a ticket and deter them from continuing the excessive behaviour. However, all noises and sounds continue and even ramps up more and more, as it got deeper into the holiday season.

                <h3>December 2023</h3>
                <h5>Storms of Sound</h5>
                <p>The sounds start becoming unbearable, and extremely excessive and lengthy to an even further extent and degree from all sources. I continue filing complaints every night I can't sleep for the entire night hoping to get police to respond or even just show up. I call the precinct and receive the same responses, as in they'll send someone out. Sometimes they do, sometimes it's too late, sometimes they just make a phone call I believe. Either way, the music always resumes, and at some point late December, the bar begins using different tactics now to avert the police responses.                     
                <br><br>
                My aunt-in-law continues to sew at the same rate, pretty much everyday. The church is now holding very lenghthy sessions everyday of the week, with me noticing them practicing or hold classes as early as 3pm. They also have random gatherings for birthdays and other small events and allow the patrons to use the venue for private events, with the full sound system speakers, including the live band instruments. 
                <br><br>
                At this point, I am experiencing all 3 parties producing an abundance of low frequency sounds at excessive levels almost 16-18 hours a day, everyday. The sewing in the morning and daytime, overlapping into the evening and night with the church's daytime drumming practices or early evening music practice, and then late evening into night sessions all the way until 10pm and even past 10pm on a few occasions. Then that's when the bar starts intensifying their music until 4am, where I would finally get some quiet and be able to sleep before dealing with the same thing tomorrow morning in possibly as early as in 4 hours, cause maybe my aunt-in-law might start at 8am, sometimes 10am, it was very random at this time. The bar also blasts music when they open at 10:30AM for 15-20 minutes, everyday as well. I start getting concerned as I get tinnitus more often and more noticably than before and consult my doctor about an ENT and also ask him for a referral for a therapist.

                <h3>January 2024</h3>
                <h5>Initial Medical Analysis</h5>
                <p>I saw an ENT specialists, Dr. Allan Levin, who diagnosed me with tinnitus and referred me to audiologist Dr. Zarina Naizam. She assured me that my hearing was fine, but the underlying problem of low-frequency exposure was still unresolved. Months later, I compare her test results to another Doctor's and find that Dr. Zarina did not conduct a hearing threshold test "LDL", even after I mentioned I had been exposed to loud bass noise and drum noises constantly. No hyperacusis was diagnosed at this point. After Dr. Zarina informed me my hearing was fine, I did not feel the need to continue any further visits to the Doctors, and felt somewhat relieved even though I was feeling symptoms of my tinnitus here and there, and thought my hearing was just possibly just experiencing temporary pain and effects from the church's NYE session. Dr. Naizam suggested I simply move if it's disturbing, but my hearing was fine. I didn't 100% agree, but decided to continue documenting the on-going situation.

                    <h5>Continued Nuisance & Difficulties of obtaining evidence</h5>
                    <p>I continued recording the noise nuisance from both the bar and the church. Since the bar started its noise issues later than the church, I had less data on the establishment, so I focused on gathering evidence for both.
                    <br><br>    
                    By this point, I was extremely frustrated with the police for their lack of action. At this stage, I couldn't even coordinate with DEP inspectors to properly investigate the bar because the bar had caught on to the policeâ€™s visits and began playing music at random timesâ€”alternating between being excessively loud and quiet. This left me in a position where I had to guess when theyâ€™d play loudly. The one-hour inspection window offered by the DEP in 1 - 2 months from now, just wasn't enough to catch them at their noisiest times let alone display the full extent of their nuisance, especially on weekends when the noise wasnâ€™t always consistent. This made it incredibly difficult to gather the necessary evidence for violations initially as well.

                <h5>Community Board Outreach</h5>
                <p>I began filing complaints with the community board about the police's failure to address the noise issue with the bar, despite my numerous 311 complaints. I detailed how Iâ€™d been documenting everything, but no real action was taken. Iâ€™m unsure if I mentioned the church at this time, but I definitely raised concerns about the bar.

                    <p>I told my uncle that I had gathered enough evidence, and I reached out to David Smith again, who had been helping me alittle with the methods and devices I should use for a digital forensics report on the sound level data I collected. 
                    <br><br>
                    Around February/March 2024, I contacted him to further pursue this method, while also looking for a third-party inspection to get official readings to use in court, especially against the church and potentially the bar (though I was still hoping to resolve things with the bar without legal action). Throughout this time, I continued documenting everything as I was still getting tinnitus attacks more and more frequently now.

                <h3>March 2024</h3>
                <h5>The Second DEP Visit</h5>
                <p> I contacted the DEP again, trying to re-engage them after failing to get solid third-party sound measurements from Officer Fuentes. The noise from the church remained a major problem. Officer Fuentes tells me he has to check with his captain for the third party sound meter reading request. He then responds with a bit jumbled text that I believe stated they don't do that. However I do end up getting a DEP inspection again and two inspectors visited my house. This time they didn't mention anything about jurisdiction. 
                <br><br>
                The inspectors find the church extremely excessive and we have our conversation documented on audio recordings, sound meter data logs and video prior to the inspectors arriving taken from my phone. They are amazed at how excessive the church is and mention they've never seen anything set up like this before. The inspectors find the church well over the limit and go over and fine the church and take pictures of their set up. Almost 20 minutes after it appears the inspectors leave their establishment, the church's music comes right back on again still at an excessive level. 
                <br><br>
                This is a systemic issue, being they literally just got issued a summon, and turned around and continued to commit the very same violation immediately after. They essentially didn't make any attempts to even lower the noise the following weeks afterwards. Keeping in mind, they have already been notified of the issue. This would continue all the way until months later, where on May 6th, Cesar randomly texts me one morning to tell me if I hear loud construction noises, they're working on soundproofing on the walls. By the time he texted they were already well into the job, and there was zero advance notices or any permits outside on the building.

                <h5>The nuisance continues...</h5>
                <p> Despite receiving several violations from the DEP, the church's noise mitigation efforts were minimal, with the sound levels hardly changing. This was an issue of heavy bass and bass drums, and the level of expertise required to mitigate such sounds. 
                <br><br>
                My aunt continues to sew daily, and the bar is still exhibiting the same excessive behaviour, however I am now focused on the church, as I feel if I can start fixing the issues one by one, it should be easier to handle between managing other aspects in my daily everyday life, such as work and personal projects along with caring for my elderly parents and pets. However, at this point, my health has suffered to a considerable degree from the inability to keep on a regular healthy schedule. I gain 20-25 lbs in those last few months, and even more later on. However, after the DEP visit, I am hopeful the issue is finally going to be resolved, and relent on documenting a bit.

                <h3>May 2024</h3>
                <h5>A pattern of chronic non-compliance and reckless disregard</h5> 
                <p>
                On May 6th, 2023, after an hour or two of hearing heavy construction sounds in the morning, Cesar texts me and lets me know if I hear construction noise, they're planning on doing some soundproofing.
                
                The church attempts to install soundproofing, and Cesar calls me over to assure me something is being done and to have a look. I am ofcourse relieved they are finally taking meaningful steps to mitigate the disturbance and visit the church and see a construction professional and a gentleman I always see attend the church working on the wall. They appear to be adding another layer to the wall, with some fuzzy soundproofing material, and then another wall called quietrock on top of that. I noticed the soundproofing didn't extend all the way to the end where my room was, towards the front of the house, and I ask them do they plan on completing the work all the way to the end here? They asked me why and said they weren't planning on doing it, but since I mentioned it was my bedroom, they would ask the pastor. My thoughts here were, if you're planning on doing soundproofing, you would most likely need to seal off the entire wall, but I was no expert and I just requested they please do so.(Afterwards, I noticed they didn't listen until months later when another team was brought in, because the whole time I could clearly hear the sound difference in that section of the wall and room, which is about 30% of my room).
                <br><br>
                Regardless, this resulted in an increase in low-frequency sounds being trapped or amplifying inside our house. This is when my hyperacusis began to really get to a point of no return and I was experiencing all the symptoms I mentioned at the highest levels.
                <br><br>
                In duration of a week or two while they were doing their construction, the sound in my house changed. I was not able to pinpoint what it was at the time, however my ears started popping a lot, then I would get tinnitus attacks, followed by headaches and then extreme dizziness and nauseous, and after awhile, full on vertigo. I began feeling like my cognitive abilities and mental health were being affected now too, as the headaches were strange, and constricting and only in certain parts of the brain sometimes. I felt my chest tightening up, and started to get chest or heart pains along with strange muscle tightness in my chest and underarm area. It wasn't only stressful but the strange mental fatigue I was experiencing felt like it was preventing me from carrying out any difficult cognitive tasks and pursuing any sort of relief or help. I would feel constantly sick and nauseous even after taking medication to alleviate the nasuea. Absolutely nothing helped.
                <br><br>
                After the two weeks the church worked on the soundproofing along the wall we share, the pastor's son Julian, along with a gentlemean who was working on the wall came over to check out the sound levels. I mention to him the entire situation of how me and my mother have been feeling sick and that I believe it's caused by the way the soundproofing was installed. I informed him I was hearing strange low frequency sounds and vibrations possibly from the HVAC being attached along the soundproof wall, which is now trapped in between the layer of soundproof walls. He replied, he believes I have sensitive hearing, and there wasn't wrong with their installation. I pointed out they have a huge central air unit sitting visibly on the back of the roof, and he along with the other gentleman dismiss my claim. I let him know again, to come check out the bass sounds to make sure since they weren't playing the drums on this occassion, and that if I do find that the soundproofing is making me sick, I am going to have to take it seriously and we'll have to go through court. To which he replied was fine implying the work was done properly. I see Julian one more time in a day or two, and ask if he's going to come check out the sounds again, because the bass is still loud. He replys with "we'll see". This was an issue because, it showed they weren't really taking my concerns very seriously at all, and me and my mother was already beginning to experience health symptoms. Lucikly, with my mother not being exposed to the bar or the sewing machine as much, her symptoms aren't as drastic and serious as mine yet.

                This is when I started reaching out to my doctors again and let them know what I was experiencing. In the following months, I first returned to Dr. Alan Levin and he diagnosed me with "acoustic phonotrauma" and suggested I research and get a second opinion from another expert. In June, I visited a Dr Stephen Warman, and an Audiologist named Vasilia Meskouris. Dr Warman diagnoses me with hyperacusis along with tinnitus and minor physical ear congestion and Dr. Meskouris mentions my hearing threshold is lower than most people my age. Dr. Warman recommends I see Dr. Sean Mcmenomey at NYU Langone for a further diagnosis and to seek treatment and Dr. Meskouris recommends I reach out to a Dr. Susan Adams, and I do so as soon as possible. Dr. Mcmenomey confirms my conditions further, provides more insight and refers me to the center for hearing with Dr. Susan Adams. I reach out to the center and they provide some information in regards to a possible treatment to the tune of $5500 to start, with no guarantees and an 80% success rate. As I am unemployed, I hold off and just focus on trying to be able to find ways to manage the condition to where I can somewhat recover, get a job and move away, or try to get better in other ways somehow. 
                <br><br>
                However it is extremely difficult and I experience a bit of shock and a lot of uncertainty. This leads me to having to isolate myself more and more often. At this point, I am extremely frustrated and file complaints to the DEP commissioners office again. This prompts the DEP to send Inspector, first name Luis I believe, to my house to take a statement from me of the ongoing issues. He tells me he'll have am Inspector call me soon.

                <h3>June 2024</h3>
                <h5>A horrible realization</h5>
                <p> 
                I proceed and attempt to schedule two inspections when the inspector calls, one for the bar and one for the church with an Inspector Milazzo from the DEP 9th Unit. He informs me he's unable to schedule a church inspection until they go through their courtdate in July, and they're so booked, the next appointment would be available in September. This is after I informed him I believed their still committing violations currently, and the issue wasn't fixed and possibly worse. He informs me he can't schedule anything for the church yet, so I let him know the situation with the bar, and how it will be tricky. I mentioned I wanted the inspection conducted on the street with inspector Luis and assumed he would relay everything that was said in the 30 minutes he was at the house taking my report. However later, it appears there was a miscommunication, as the inspectors that arrived was not ready to conduct an inspection from the street.
                <br><br>
                This is when I spoke to the DEP again, informing them of the issue still persisting, however they inform me they can't do anything until the church has their court date for the initial summons. I then request an inspection for the bar. To which I explain the situation of how they try to hide and avoid inspections from the police currently. I let him know, for this reason, they resorted to playing after 2am the loudest because they know the police won't be able to respond by the time they close at 4am. They also turn the music up and down at random times and it varies with their playlist on certain days. Inspector Milazzo tells me he can only give me an inspection from 12am to 1am the latest, in a month from then on July 18. To which I just accept because there isn't a choice really if I want any chance of relief. 
                <br><br>
                This did throw me off, as it seemed like I was reporting a crime being commited from 2 A.M. - 4 A.M. and the Inspector responded with well, we can send someone at 12 A.M. - 1 A.M.

                    <h5>Increasing Health Decline</h5>
                    <p>My health and mental well-being worsened due to the ongoing noise issues. Despite medical evaluations and continued documentation of the noise, no substantial resolution was reached. The church's soundproofing is still improperly installed and they were still extremely excessive without even noticing or caring enough to come back and even check if the sound was better.
                    <br><br>
                    Everyday began feeling worse and worse. And the hope of relief seemed to be getting further and further as I found out more and more about my condition. Not only was I now aware of the imminent health symptoms and conditions that were affecting me, but I was now I aware it would be permanent and the sources that caused my conditions would still be continuing their excessive behaviour in my home, while the condition was severe enough where I might not be able to have the ability to get away or even fight back. Essentially, a feeling of knowing your the inevitable demise and decline of your health and being unable to do anything to stop it. There were times I did not know if I was just going to have to hear extremely loud and painful sounds for the rest of my life until I went crazy or not, and the matter of when and how long until this would happen. I felt like I was on the brink of insanity every single day, and that was the main fight at the forefront at the time.

                <h5>Nomadic Relief and Mitigation Tactics</h5>
                <p>The combination of noise from the church, the bar, and my aunt's sewing remained unrelenting. I continued to juggle personal and professional obligations, including business ventures and family responsibilities, while pursuing solutions for the noise problem as my condition actually begins to get worse and worse. I resort into driving to parks or areas I believe are quiet enough. I learn a lot of areas are not as quiet as they seem, I start understanding the effects the low frequency sounds have, and start researching about my condition more and more from my car using my phone and tablet. This was the only place I felt safe at the time, because I would be able to simply drive off if any dangerous sounds were present. For the next few months, I would only return home mostly after 4 A.M. or on certain days, I felt sane and healthy enough to stay in my home.

                <h5>Relentless sewing continues, despite multiple notices of harmful and health decline</h5>
                <p>Trying to find ways to manage the noise, I have to leave my house almost everyday due to my aunt's random sewing. After repeatedly telling her and my uncle about my condition, I cease my personal communication with them. My parents still talk to them as a way to stay amicable while we still live here and try to find better living arangements. I resort to having driving out to parts of eastern Queens, and eventually Long Island, essentially away from any traffic with as little people as possible in the daytime. The church attempted multiple ways to mitigate the sound, to no avail. The first contractor no longer shows up and I witness another team is brought in to 'fix' the soundproofing. They begin tearing down the old one, and making adjustments, which still aren't very satisfactory at all, and still leak in weird ways. The sound pressure in my house is still weird and I still feel extreme symptoms at home. Although now I am alittle bit more unaware if they are from the soundproofing or just the nature of my condition and symptoms.

                <h3>September 2024</h3>
                <h5>My condition worsens, and I experience new physical symptoms.</h5>
                <p>My aunt continues to randomly sew everyday. The bar continues to play music from 10pm - 4am with excessive volme and bass. I begin trying to contact 311 and get the local police to stop them again, and go through the procedure to see if they are now be able to stop the noise. I add a security camera to the front of my house facing the bar, now recording any interactions they may have if the police arrive, or with their late night activities of blasting music from their cars, fighting, yelling etc. This evidence is also synced up with how I do my usual audio,video,sound meter, sound app recordings on a few occasions as well. This should show a level of consistency. I begin documenting the noise from the bar more openly, and get sound readings closer to their establishment in hopes to obtain accurate sound readings and evidence.
                <br><br>
                I continue trying find ways to mitigate the noise. I begin to notice my condition worsening, however, I am still not sure what is exactly causing the symptoms, where these noises are all coming from, and how quiet does it have to be in order for me to exist without feeling sick or getting headaches. 
                <br><br>
                By the end of September I believe, I notice myself begin to burp excessively when being exposed to low frequency sounds, and I begin getting some chest pains, sharp pains under my arms again. I start feeling like my brain is being torn or warped as part of the headaches. Similar to the initial feelings when I first felt sick. This is horrible and lasts for as long as I'm exposed to low frequencies, however, it does help me identify where the sounds are coming from more. I focus on trying to recover enough everyday to stay fully conscious as long as possible. Sometimes I feel alittle bit like the sounds are tearing my sanity apart from lack of sleep, and I can't fully recover fast enough before being exposed to low frequency noises again.

                    <h5>Another attempt to fix the soundproofing</h5>
                    <p>
                        The church has made several adjustments to the soundproofing after witnessing me document their sound from my window sill on several occasions during their recent sessions as well possibly hearing me complain about feeling sick out the window as well.
                        <br><br>
                        They hire another contractor or the second contractor continued his work and made further adjustments. Now the sound is much better when they play music, however the bass still leaks through excessively, and the weird sounds and issue with the hvac still persist now different ways, clearly showing their soundproofing mitigation attempts are still janky and not done properly with expert consultation. 
                        <br><br>
                        I record the sound often throughout the day while I'm not home and may have the construction sounds of them tearing down the walls, and hammering away when building it up again. I do have a video of when that same team was painting the walls on the balcony and door frames from the outside of the church. They did this the same time as hammering the walls maybe to hide the fact, so I do believe that the soundproofing was adjusted once again, cause I could clearly hear and feel hammering along our shared walls. They also had a table saw set up outside as well, clearly doing major construction activity with no permits or notice to us again what so ever.

                <h3>October 2024</h3>
                <h5></h5>
                <p>
                    Further research has me to believe that the condition is triggered by certain frequencies in which I have identified before, however, I can now see which ones affect me more and to what extent. This helps me manage the condition to an extent where I can start somewhat having control the recovery phase which happens during rest(but not always). However, everyday I wake up with the condition in my current living space, I go through the same thing again. I begin with being horribly awaken at some point(or several points if I'm able to go back to sleep, and usually every 2 hours), with certain low frequency sounds under 200 mhz exceeding as low as 20 decibels on it's own 1/3 octave band. Which doesn't take much, especially in the daytime. My aunt's sewing machine measures at 50-60 decibels on the 120hz 1/3 octave band constantly when powered on for reference. I then leave the house and try to find quiet areas depending on the day and time, I usually have to end up in areas and places very far from where I live, and further away from the city, traffic or people. I then return home after 4am, after the bar is closed, and try to study about my condition or work on related topics, eat, sleep, essentially find my way out of this endless loop. 
                    <br><br>
                    In late October, I realized I wasn't going to be able to stay sane long enough to find cheaper treatment or treatment on my own, let alone any ways to even get some relief.
                    <br><br>
                    <h5>Reaching out to Dr. Adams again</h5>
                    <br><br>
                    I reach out to Dr. Adams again and she replies on Oct 22nd, this time getting a hold of the doctor personally. I schedule a 15 minute phone consultation for the next day on the 23rd, but ends up actually being on the 25th.
                    <br><br>
                    This 15 minute phone consultation which actually turned out to be 30 minutes, was a huge difference and turning point of relief. Dr. Adams, was not only familiar with what I had been experiencing, but was able to explain to me and further diagnose me to a level of understanding in which all the other doctors lacked the experience with before. She was able to give me a few mitigation tactics to help me cope but was actually unable to treat me further and suggested my condition is even much more complicated than it appeared, and that I might also have other conditions such as "misophonia".
                    <br><br> 
                    Dr. Adams refers me to another specialist in Connecticut she mentioned would be better suited to treat me, a Dr. Natan Bauman, a former Director of the Hearing, Speech, and Language Clinic at Yale New Haven Hospital, with a faculty appointment at Yale Medical School. I reach out to the doctor immediately and finally get in touch with someone after two weeks. On November 11, 2024 the doctor's office returns my call/email and schedules me for an initial evaluation on November 20th, 2024.

                <h5>Finally, alittle bit more concrete hope.</h5>
                <p>

                    After reaching out to Dr. Bauman's office, I set up the earliest appointment in about 2-3 weeks on November 20th, for an initial evaluation and consultation. I noticed the office was much more familiar with my condition and felt a bit more hopeful after speaking with them.
                    <br><br>
                    <h5>The Initial Evaluation with Dr. Bauman. November 20th, 2024</h5>

                    I visit Dr.Bauman's office in Connecticut and after the initial hour evaluation, the doctor gives me a preliminary diagnosis of phonophobia along with the hyperacusis and tinnitus. He lets me know we would require further evaluation and testing on the next visit, but he did believe he may be able to help with treatment utilizing various tactics which include cognitive therapy along with specialized custom hearing devices.
                    <br><br>
                    After some consideration about the managing the costs, I decide to take the next available appointment and start the testing and evaluation to begin treatment. The doctor informs me that he would like the equipment to be ready for the evaluation, and I agree and we purchase the hardware to be ready to begin treatment as soon as possible right after the evaluation. The next available appointment was on December 31, 2024, at 8:30 A.M. and I do everything I can to make sure I have everything necessary for the appointment and am able to make the appointment with no problem. This included booking a room the day before and after the appointment to make sure I was able to travel with enough sleep due to the bar's late night activity ending at 4 A.M. everyday, even though December 30th, was a Monday.

                    Dr. Bauman conducts his testing and evaluation and I believe the technical hearing test results were able to show a great deal. He was able to measure my current threshold for specific octave bands and help me identify the aspects we needed to work on with each specific triggering sound. 
                    <br><br>
                    The doctor programs the hearing devices and about four to five hours later, after a bit more testing and fitting, I should be more equipped to start making an attempt to regain my senses with the doctor and his team's help.

                <p>

                    After leaving my home for a few days, I notice a drastic change in my health for the better. I felt I was able to breath, and my mind was more clear. The headaches subsided, and the burping stopped.
                    <br><br>
                    This is further accentuated when I return home as well, and start feeling the symptoms I experienced before I left, start coming back almost immediately. This further pushes me to believe my suspicions with the faulty soundproofing and I start contacting the authorities again with the new information.
                    <br><br>
                    My aunt continues to sew randomly throughout the day despite being fully aware of the seriousness of my condition now. The bar also continues their excessive behaviour during the afterhours all the way til 4:00 A.M. every day. The church was much louder, however I did notify the police to inform them of it, and I am currently waiting to see if the pattern will continue. I am also awaiting another DEP inspection for both parties, and hopefully to also discuss with the inspector the options I have with my aunt-in-law/landlady and her use of the industrial sewing machine. 
                    <br><br>
                    I continue to contact the authorities in regards to the situation with the bar and try to find a way to escalate the issue with the police due to the bar's aversion tactics, and DEP's difficulties scheduling availability. If anyone can give these guys a ticket to deter them or find evidence of the disturbance and nuisance, it would most likely be the authorities that are located about 4-5 blocks away from the bar. However, this proves extremely difficult with only filing 311 reports and providing details through 311 channels or even calling the precinct.

The officer's responses vary from things like: they are only able to give the bar a verbal warning, to yes we can give them tickets, to no we can't give them tickets, to call the DOB, call the community board, repeating things like, "we'll they're a commercial establishment and is allowed to play music afterhours", to which I replied, yes, but certainly not to excessive sound levels. An Officer Cazzo or Casso, from the 110th precinct iterated the same thing as well on a recent phone call. He seemed adamant the bar was not committing any crimes and they were not able to help with more than a verbal warning each time. I let him know it's not logical for the bar to be making the same excessive sounds, and sound levels as a car with a loud exhaust in violation, but not be able to receive tickets. He tries to tell me, well the car is passing by and goes away, to which I confirm as he just proved my point to himself? I let him know that, it's even worse when the source is stationary for 6-8 hours in front of your house every night then no? I was confused there, and let him know that.

                        He relinguishes alittle and agrees. He then informs me I would have to just keep callling them each time the bar was excesssive, which seemed like a complete failure to resolve an on-going issue that's about to reach 2 years now. When I questioned the officer, if they aren't committing a crime, it must be some sort of violation? He puts me on hold for about 15 minutes, and I hear him pick up the phone a few times to see if I hung up, and eventually I simply call back and ask for a liutenant. The officer than quickly reassures me they are doing absolutely everything they can to resolve the issue. I push alittle more and let him know that I'm already seeing a doctor for hearing conditions, I am looking to escalate the issue because it hasn't been resolved in over a year, and I would like to speak to a higher ranking officer than the neighborhood coordinator, who I've spoken to on multiple occassions, an Officer Fuentes. Officer Cazzo or Casso, denies me again and tries to change the subject away from esclating to a liutentant. As I could clearly see what was happening, I decided to let him know this is a failure of the system and that I would be continuing to find ways to escalate the issue. A few days later, after emailing the DEP myself religiously, I receive an email stating they've been contacted by the police department and would like to help set up an inspection.
