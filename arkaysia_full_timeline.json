The church received numerous violations and fines from the Department of Buildings and I believe this highlighted an underlying issue here.

This video shows what me and my family actually went through EVERY Saturday and Sunday morning, and evenings on weekdays, for over a decade. However, when I returned home in 2021, they now had a different sound system or turned it up, and they played much much longer and still start as early as 7:30am. I am using an app called \"Sound Meter\" which isn't as fully featured and detailed as the other apps I later discover. However, the app displays an estimated reading along with the audio from the video. It should clearly show how loud they are since the sound is recorded from inside my house with the windows initially closed. The video starts off with the session already underway and with mostly the drumming and low frequency bass sounds, that are actually the trigger sounds that eventually led to my hearing and other health conditions. After about 3 minutes, you can hear only the drums still continue while the other instruments and fade out and come back at around 7 minutes to the end of the video. At around 22 minutes, you can also see me bring the phone to the window and you can also get an idea of how much sound is being emitted from the front of their property as well. You can also notice how the music is also almost none stop for the entire video, and that is just one segment of their session. The decibel levels reach the high 60's in db(a) measured from inside my home, which means the db(C) which is weighted for the low frequency sounds you hear, should be a decent amount higher, and easily in the 70-80 db(C) range judging by how much louder the lower frequency sounds are here.</p>"

However, on my side there was no difference in the sound levels, only in the balance of the sounds. \n                \n                Eventually by late April, the noise really hasn't changed, and it seems all they've done was move the speakers around. There was no real mitigation tactics in regards to real soundproofing in place for the level of sound they were producing from a fully equipped live band with speakers, and a choir, from a source that's very close in proximity. I remained patient as I understood soundproofing is costly. However, since there was no difference and the sound always reverted back to being loud, I questioned whether they were stalling to buy time. Which I understood again, how expensive these things could be, but felt they could've at the very least turned down the music or found other ways in the meantime.</p>"

The first video is of a 9am drumming session, and what I would hear every Sunday starting 2023. Although it isn't painfully loud, it is audible, and continues for a considerable amount of time. Long enough to wake you up as your survival senses and responses kick in while you are sleeping. \n                \n                This would go on for about 30 - 45 minutes for their morning session. The recording is a video with audio taken on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 capturing a sound meter app I am using on my tablet. The location is in my room on a small table.\n                \n                The second video is a continuation and later in the session, at 2pm. This is live session with the choir and all the equipment turned on, the background sound is my TV in the living room due to the door in my room being open. You can hear the drums and bass are the most prominent and create warping sounds in the room from the reverberation at times. At approximately 7 minutes and 20 seconds in, you can hear the bass buzzing and this is another one of the harmful trigger sounds which has led to my hearing conditions. Towards the end of the video, I take the recording out into my living room and where you can still hear their music, basically stretching from one side of my house to the other. This is what I mean by I have no escape from the low frequency sounds and pounding of the drumming sounds, no matter where I am in my house. My TV is on in the background as a reference on how loud the drumming is.\n                \n                These two videos are a good example of the particular sounds which I was exposed to on almost a daily basis, for very lengthy sessions spanning 6-8 hours a day, and 10+ hours on holidays where the church is open from dawn until 10pm or 2am on New Years. These are the sounds I had to study through, work through, sleep through and essentially live my life around.</p>"

I start getting concerned as I get tinnitus more often and more noticeably than before and consult my doctor about an specialist and also ask him for a referral for a therapist.</p>"

Dr. Naizam suggested I simply move if it's disturbing, but my hearing was fine. I didn't 100% agree, but decided to continue documenting the on-going situation.</p>"

However I do end up getting a DEP inspection again and two inspectors visited my house. This time they didn't mention anything about jurisdiction. \n                \n                The inspectors find the church extremely excessive and we have our conversation documented on audio recordings, sound meter data logs and video prior to the inspectors arriving taken from my phone. They are amazed at how excessive the church is and mention they've never seen anything set up like this before. The inspectors find the church well over the limit and go over and issue the church multiple violations and take pictures of their set up. Almost 20 minutes after it appears the inspectors leave their establishment, the church's music comes right back on again still at an excessive level. \n                \n                This is a systemic issue, being they literally just got issued a summons, and turned around and continued to commit the very same violation immediately after. They essentially didn't make any attempts to even lower the noise the following weeks afterwards. Keeping in mind, they have already been notified of the issue. This would continue all the way until months later, where on May 6th, Cesar randomly texts me one morning to tell me if I hear loud construction noises, they're working on soundproofing on the walls. By the time he texted they were already well into the job, and there was zero advance notices or any permits outside on the building.</p>"

I am ofcourse relieved they are finally taking meaningful steps to mitigate the disturbance after over a decade and was invited over to the church to check out the soundproofing. \n                \n                I see a construction professional and a patron of the church I always see, working on the wall we share. They appear to be adding another layer to the wall, with some fuzzy soundproofing material, and then another wall they informed me I believed called \"QuietRock\" on top of that, which is a type of soundproofing wall, both layers over the existing layer and with the HVAC between those walls still. I noticed the soundproofing didn't extend all the way to the end towards the front of the house, as my room on my side does, but on their side it's their main entrance/foyer for guests, for the event space on the first floor. After this observation, I ask them do they plan on completing the work all the way to the end here? They asked me why and said they weren't planning on doing it, but since I mentioned it was my bedroom, they would ask the pastor. \n                \n                My thoughts here were, if you're planning on doing soundproofing, you would most likely need to seal off the entire wall, but I was no expert and I just requested they please do so.(Afterwards, I am uncertain if they listened or did the work properly, because the whole time I believed I could clearly hear a sound difference in that section of the wall and room, which is about 30% of my room).\n                \n                Regardless, I believe this resulted in an increase in low-frequency sounds reverberating, being trapped, or amplifying inside our house. I am uncertain how to describe it specifically, but it sounded like living in a wind tunnel with unusual sounds. This is when I started noticing the strange headaches, ears popping, tinnitus attacks and faster heartbeat.\n                \n                During this time, I believe this is when the Hyperacusis began to really set in and get to a point of no return and I was experiencing all the symptoms I mentioned at the highest levels.\n                \n                In duration of a week or two while they were doing their construction, the sound in my house changed without me noticing the harmful effects. I was not able to pinpoint what it was at the time, however my ears started popping a lot, then I would get tinnitus attacks, followed by cloudy and painful headaches and then extreme dizziness and nausea, and after awhile, full on vertigo. \n                \n                I started to begin feeling my cognitive abilities and mental health were being affected now too, as the headaches were strange, and constricting and only in certain parts of the brain sometimes. I felt my chest tightening up, and started to get chest or heart pains along with strange muscle tightness in my chest and underarm area. I would always wake up in a rush or panic feeling my heart racing. It wasn't only stressful but the strange mental fatigue I was experiencing felt like it was preventing me from carrying out any difficult cognitive tasks and pursuing any sort of relief or help. I would feel constantly sick and nauseous even after taking medication to alleviate the nausea. Absolutely nothing helped.\n                \n                After the two weeks the church worked on the soundproofing along the wall we share, the pastor's son Julian, along with the church patron(not the construction guy or contractor) who was working on the wall came over to check out the sound levels before an evening session began. \n                \n                I mention to him the entire situation of how me and my mother have been feeling sick and that I believe it's caused by the way the soundproofing was installed. I informed him I was hearing strange low frequency sounds and vibrations possibly from the HVAC being attached along the soundproof wall, which is now trapped in between the layer of soundproof walls and materials, over the existing drywall. \n                \n                He replied, he believes I have sensitive hearing, and there wasn't anything wrong with their installation. I pointed out they have a huge central air unit sitting visibly on the back of the roof, and he along with the other gentleman dismiss my claim. \n                \n                I let him know again, to come check out the bass sounds to make sure the soundproofing works properly, since they weren't playing the drums on this occassion. I also let them know that if I do find that the soundproofing is making me sick, I am going to have to take it seriously and we'll have to go through court. To which he replied was fine implying the work was done properly. \n                \n                I see Julian one more time in a day or two, and ask if he's going to come check out the sounds again, because the bass is still loud. Unfortunately, he replys with \"we'll see\". This was an issue because, it felt like they weren't really taking my concerns very seriously at all anymore and they felt like they've done their due diligence and completed the work, but me and my mother were already beginning to experience health symptoms and they were worsening.\n                \n                Luckily, with my mother not being exposed to the bar or the sewing machine as much, her symptoms aren't as drastic and serious as mine yet. To be honest, I also feel because sees how bad my symptoms are affecting me, she doesn't want to add any additional burden onto the family as well. \n                \n                After informing Julian and the Church representative when they visited about me and my mother feeling sick and the soundproofing being improperly installed. I email Cesar again and attempt to describe what I'm hearing on my end, and mention the sound is actually worse in strange ways. At this point, I inform him for the last time that I suggest he hire a sound consultant/expert. \n                   \n                The Journey for Medical Treatment Begins\n \n                This is when I started reaching out to my doctors again and let them know what I was experiencing. In the following months, I first returned to Dr. Alan Levin where he diagnosed me with \"acoustic phonotrauma\" and suggested I research and get a second opinion from another expert. In June, I visited a Dr. Stephen Warman, and an Audiologist named Vasilia Meskouris. Dr. Warman diagnoses me with hyperacusis along with tinnitus and minor physical ear congestion and Dr. Meskouris mentions my hearing threshold is lower than most people my age. Dr. Warman refers me to see Dr. Sean Mcmenomey at NYU Langone for a further diagnosis and to seek treatment and Dr. Meskouris recommends I reach out to a Dr. Susan Adams. I proceed do so as soon as possible, with the NYU doctor first. \n                \n                Dr. Mcmenomey confirms my conditions further, provides more insight and refers me to the Center for Hearing with Dr. Susan Adams.\n                \n                I reach out to the center and they provide some information in regards to a possible treatment to the tune of $5500 to start, with no guarantees and an 80% success rate. \n                \n                As I am technically unemployed, I hold off and just focus on trying to be able to find ways to manage the condition to where I can somewhat recover, get some kind of means of sustainable consistent work and move away, and just try to get better in other ways first somehow. \n                \n                However, this proved to be extremely difficult and I experience a bit of shock and a lot of uncertainty. This leads me to having to isolate myself more and more often. At this point, I am extremely frustrated and file complaints to the DEP commissioners office again. This prompts the DEP to send Inspector, first name Luis I believe, to my house to take a statement from me of the ongoing issues. He tells me he'll have an inspector call me soon.\n                \n                It's important to note that I fully notified the Inspector Luis of my hearing issues and he is fully aware I was now seeing a doctor for these issues when taking his statement. He then proceeded to walk around outside of the bar and inspect the space.\n                \n                I also reached out to an Inspector Buffa as well, who is part of the DEP and he did call me back to leave me a message, but Inspector Luis came to the house a day or two after, and I didn't see the need to be in contact with multiple agents.\n                \n\nRead More\n\nMedical Documentation & Documents of communication with Authorities\n\nLinks to medical documentation\nLinks to documentation with authorities</p>"

He informs me he's unable to schedule a church inspection until they go through their court date in July, and because they're so booked, the next appointment would be available in September. This is after I informed him I believed they're still at a violational sound level, and the issue wasn't fixed and possibly getting worse. \n                \n                He informs me he can't schedule anything for the church yet, so I let him know the situation with the bar, and how it will be tricky. I mentioned I wanted the inspection conducted on the street with inspector Luis earlier and assumed he would relay everything that was said in the 30 minutes he was at the house taking my report. \n                \n                However later, it appears there was a miscommunication, as the inspectors that arrived was not ready to conduct an inspection from the street.\n                \n                This is when I spoke to the DEP again, informing them of the issue still persisting, however they inform me they can't do anything until the church has their court date for the initial summons. I then request an inspection for the bar. To which I explain the situation of how they try to hide and avoid inspections from the police currently. I let him know, for this reason, they resorted to playing after 2am the loudest because they know the police won't be able to respond by the time they close at 4am. They also turn the music up and down at random times and it varies with their playlist on certain days. Inspector Milazzo tells me he can only give me an inspection from 12am to 1am the latest, in a month from then on July 18. To which I just accept because there isn't a choice really, if I want any chance of relief. \n                \n                This did throw me off, as it seemed like I was reporting a crime being committed from 2 A.M. - 4 A.M. and the Inspector responded with well, we can send someone at 12 A.M. - 1 A.M.. It also seemed like they were asking me when is the best time, but at the same time, stating, we do have this time window but in 2 months from now, where a lot of harm and change could occur in the meantime. Essentially, I also felt like this also allowed for a lot of inconsistencies to be possible, as I couldn't really show the times establishment was excessive to the degree or extent they were actually being. I also felt like this is how a sound inspection should be conducted at the very least, with the element of surprise within a reasonable time frame. For example, if they just happen to be closed or not as loud on that day for whatever reason, I would have to go through the situation another 2 months, a total of 4 months now, before getting another visit. \n                \n                This is why I believe this process should offer more a more streamlined and transparent approach in a sense where you can just simply schedule these inspection appointments online like a DMV appointment or other appointments now available with other government agencies. The appointment should also be discrete and available upon request, not as if it's some special priviledge. The scheduled date and time of the appointment should only known to the Inspectors and system involved. This would prevent/deter favorable establishments from receiving biased inspection times and outcomes.</p>"

Regardless of the embarassment I feel at this point, I literally have no choice but to take these matters into my own hands before my own health gets worse or it starts taking a toll on my parents even more. So I try to document the issue relentlessly, but still try to maintain a level of respect for their business operation and be as quick and discrete as I can with the recordings.

Sometimes I feel a little bit like the sounds are tearing my sanity apart from lack of sleep, and I can't fully recover fast enough before being exposed to low frequency noises or whatever it is that is making me feel horribly sick again.</p>"

Dr. Adams, was not only familiar with what I had been experiencing, but was able to explain to me and further diagnose me to an extent the other doctors weren't as specialized to do, due to the extreme rarity of the condition.  \n                    \n                    She was able to give me a few mitigation tactics to help me cope but was unfortunately unable to treat me further and suggested my condition is even much more complicated than it appeared, and that I might also have other related conditions such as \"misophonia\".\n                     \n                    Dr. Adams refers me to another specialist in Connecticut she mentioned would be better suited to treat me, a Dr. Natan Bauman, a former Director of the Hearing, Speech, and Language Clinic at Yale New Haven Hospital now with his own private practice in the New Haven area.\n                    \n                    I reach out to the doctor immediately and am able to get in touch with someone after some time. On November 11, 2024 the doctor's office returns my call/email and schedules me for an initial evaluation on November 20th, 2024.</p>"

I noticed the office staff in general was much more familiar with my condition and felt a bit more hopeful after speaking with them.\n                    \nThe Initial Evaluation with Dr. Bauman. November 20th, 2024\n\n                    I visit Dr.Bauman's office in Connecticut and after the initial hour evaluation, the doctor gives me a preliminary diagnosis of phonophobia along with the hyperacusis and tinnitus. He lets me know we would require further evaluation and testing on the next visit, but he did believe he may be able to help with treatment utilizing various tactics which include cognitive therapy along with specialized custom hearing devices.\n                    \n                    After some consideration about managing the costs, I decide to take the next available appointment and start the testing and evaluation to begin treatment. \n                    \n                    The doctor informs me that he would like the equipment to be ready for the evaluation, and ofcourse I agree and we purchase the hardware to be ready to begin treatment as soon as possible, immediately after the evaluation. \n                    \n                    The next available appointment was on December 31, 2024, at 8:30 A.M. and I do everything I can to make sure I have everything necessary for the appointment and am able to make the appointment with no problem. This included booking a room at a hotel the day before and after the appointment to make sure I was able to travel with enough sleep due to the bar's late night activity ending at 4 A.M. everyday, even though December 30th, was a Monday, and the appointment was on December 31st. I was also lucky enough to find a hotel with soundproof rooms in the area.</p>"

I felt I was able to breathe slightly better, my heart was beating normal, and my mind was more clear. The headaches subsided, and the burping stopped. Unfortunately, this didn't last for long.\n                    \n                    This is further contrasted when I return home, and start feeling the symptoms I experienced before start coming back almost immediately. This pushes me to believe my suspicions with the faulty soundproofing and I start contacting the authorities again with the new information. I contact the D.E.P for strange sounds and for their music still being excessively loud, as well as the D.O.B for unapproved construction contrary to plans, as I realized if they didn't get a professional sound consulatant and I saw no permits outside on all those times they did construction, that they may have not followed proper building codes and construction procedures.\n                    \n                    My aunt continues to sew randomly throughout the day despite being fully aware of the seriousness of my condition now. The bar also continues their excessive behavior during the afterhours all the way til 4:00 A.M. every day. The church's sound levels are still in violation, however I did notify the police to inform them of it, and I am currently waiting to see if the pattern will continue. I am also awaiting another DEP inspection for both parties, and hopefully to also discuss with the inspector the options I have with my aunt-in-law/landlady and her use of the industrial sewing machine. \n                    \n                    I continue to contact the authorities in regards to the situation with the bar and try to find a way to escalate the issue with the police due to the bar's aversion tactics, and DEP's difficulties with scheduling and availability. If anyone can give these guys a ticket to deter them or find evidence of the disturbance and nuisance, it should most likely be the authorities that are located about a few blocks away from the bar. However, this proves extremely difficult with only filing 311 reports and providing details through 311 channels or even calling the 110th Precinct.</p>"
