<h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      I am here today because of an ongoing noise issue that has been occurring for at least a decade and a half. 
      The situation escalated in May 2024 after the neighboring church installed faulty soundproofing in an attempt 
      to reduce noise from their live band sessions following multiple noise violations from the DEP.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, this work was done without any professional or official oversight, without any environmental 
      sound or vibration studies conducted on our side of the house, and without any treatment or soundproofing 
      on our side of the shared structure. Instead of reducing the problem, the improper installation caused 
      the shared wall and structure to resonate with low-frequency vibrations, amplifying and carrying them 
      throughout my home. The result is that my living space now resonates with constant low-frequency energy (29Hz, 59Hz, and 117–120Hz), further worsened by nightly music from a nearby bar (10 p.m. - 4 a.m., currently starting as early as 6 p.m.) and by the way the faulty soundproofing amplifies ordinary household noises — including an industrial sewing machine used by my landlady directly above my bedroom. These combined exposures mean that at any time of day, my home is filled with excessive and harmful noise.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a result, I have developed serious health issues, including a hearing sensitivity condition called 
      <strong>Hyperacusis</strong>, which causes me to hear certain normal, everyday sounds at volumes 5–10 times 
      louder than a typical person. I now have to wear custom hearing aids to help reduce these sounds as part of 
      my therapy process. In addition, I experience <strong>shortness of breath similar to asthma 
      patients</strong> and <strong>sleep disturbances similar to mild sleep apnea</strong>, both of which are recently diagnosed by specialists, and commonly linked to prolonged exposure to low-frequency noise and vibrations.
    </p>

    <p>
      My parents are also experiencing symptoms consistent with prolonged exposure to low-frequency noise and 
      vibration. Despite repeated attempts to resolve the matter with my landlords and through city agencies, 
      no effective steps have been taken by any party to correct the problem. The conditions have made it 
      impossible for me to use my home comfortably; I often can only return to sleep, as staying for extended 
      periods makes me physically ill.
    </p>

<h2>Intent & Legal Context</h2>
<p>
This proceeding is about ensuring transparency,
accountability, and full remediation for unsafe conditions created by improper construction
and soundproofing decisions by the neighboring church. These decisions have left my home
exposed to structural resonance and persistent low-frequency vibration.
</p>

<p>
While my landlord has also been negatively affected by these conditions, he
remains legally obligated to provide a safe and habitable residence. The record reflects that
he has not taken the steps necessary to secure professional assessments, require corrective
action from the church, or initiate an insurance claim — leaving my family and I unprotected and injured.
</p>

<p>
In addition, a nearby bar contributes recurring nighttime low-frequency noise that further
undermines habitability and violates established noise codes. Though secondary to the
church’s structural impact, it compounds an already hazardous condition — a home already
resonating with improperly contained low-frequency vibrations. The bar’s amplified bass,
often blasting from 6 p.m. until 4 a.m., is not just disruptive in isolation; layered onto a
residence destabilized by structural resonance, it creates a continuous and extreme nuisance.
Both the church and the bar have therefore generated independent bases for liability: for me
and my family through injury and loss of use, and for my landlord through the direct
interference with his property and his tenants’ habitability.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of this case is therefore threefold:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Ensure all parties — including the church, landlord, and their insurers —
      provide access, records, and disclosures so the full extent of the problem cannot be hidden
      or minimized.</li>
  <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Recognize that the church’s faulty work caused the condition, but also
      that the landlord has a parallel duty to enforce habitability and pursue remedies.</li>
  <li><strong>Proper Remediation:</strong> Secure court-ordered inspections and a professional mitigation plan,
      with progress overseen so that the matter is corrected promptly and in good faith.</li>
</ul>
