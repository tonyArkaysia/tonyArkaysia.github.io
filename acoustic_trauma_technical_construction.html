    <h1>Structural Vibration Technical Breakdown</h1>

    <p>
      This page outlines the mechanical and structural reasons for ongoing vibration issues occurring within my living space, caused by faulty construction work and improper installations by the neighboring church.
    </p>

    <h2>Overview of the Structure</h2>
    <p>
      The neighboring church extended their first floor several years ago, adding a building extension roughly 20-30 feet long. On the roof of this extension, they installed a large central HVAC unit.
    </p>

    <p>
      The HVAC system rests atop two large steel beams, which span across the extension from wall to wall. These beams, although on their roof and sits on their structure, are directly seated onto the shared structural walls which run along the middle of our homes— meaning vibrations from the HVAC system are transmitted directly into our common walls.
    </p>

    <h2>Vibration Transmission Mechanism</h2>
    <p>
      When the HVAC system operates (particularly during cooling cycles), it generates significant low-frequency mechanical vibrations. These vibrations travel from the unit → into the steel beams → and into the shared masonry wall.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once inside the shared wall, the vibrations propagate throughout the structure, eventually dissipating into adjacent floors and walls — particularly into my living space, located toward the front of the house where vibration energy accumulates and magnifies.
    </p>

    <h2>Faulty Soundproofing Installation</h2>
    <p>
      In May 2024, after being issued multiple noise violations,the church installed a soundproofing wall along the shared structure without any permits or consultation with a soundproofing engineer. This wall was intended to reduce airborne noise transmission from musical sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the addition of layered materials without isolating the structure properly instead trapped low-frequency energy inside the wall assembly. With no proper decoupling or vibration isolation, the structure now acts like a resonator — worsening vibration transmission into my home.
    </p>

    <h2>Air Gaps and Unequal Soundproofing</h2>
    <p>
      Another critical flaw is that the church side of the wall is soundproofed, while my side, constructed for residential use, is untreated and contains multiple air gaps. These gaps allow both airborne and vibrational energy to leak into my space without any resistance.
    </p>

    <img src="resources/case_imgs/drywall-framing.webp" alt="Overview of Extension and HVAC Location">        

    <p>
      The imbalance between the treated and untreated sides causes energy to reflect, concentrate, and break through weak points — amplifying the presence of low-frequency noise and structural resonance inside my apartment.
    </p>


    <h2>Lack of Professional Environmental Sound Study</h2>
    <p>
      At no time before, during, or after the soundproofing installation did the church perform a professional environmental sound or vibration impact study on my side of the property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a formal assessment, they failed to detect how these construction changes would affect neighboring structures — leading to avoidable, ongoing defects that continue to worsen over time.
    </p>

    <h2>Resulting Effects</h2>
    <p>
      The persistent structural vibrations have made my living environment unsafe and uninhabitable, contributing directly to significant disturbances and physical harm, as documented elsewhere.

    <p>ZOLA Zoning Map. Their property, Lot #14, sits on an R6-B Residential zone entirely. While our property(Lot #13) sits halfway on the C1-3 border. Possibly to prevent our residential apartment from being surrounded by commercial properties.</p>
