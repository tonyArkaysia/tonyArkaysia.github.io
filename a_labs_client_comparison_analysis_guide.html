          A practical look at your options: a big NYC agency, a developer on a gig site, or a

      <h2><span class="icon">👀</span> The Real Choice You’re Making</h2>
      <p class="tagline">
        When you decide who builds your system, you’re not just choosing software. You’re choosing
        who gets to “think for” your business digitally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most local businesses end up picking between:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">A big NYC agency</span> – professional, but expensive and built for bigger clients.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">A cheap freelancer on a gig site</span> – fast and inexpensive, but usually using prebuilt templates and scripts.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Doing nothing</span> – staying with pen & paper, or tools that don’t really fit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A_LABS exists to give you a fourth option: <span class="highlight">a custom system designed around your exact
        business, at a price that makes sense for a bodega, barbershop, salon, restaurant, or gym in this city.</span>

    <!-- About Tony -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2><span class="icon">🧠</span> Who’s Actually Designing Your System?</h2>
      <p class="tagline">
        Not just “a programmer.” Someone who has actually run the kinds of businesses you’re running.
      </p>
      <p>
        A_LABS is led by <span class="highlight">Prachya “Tony” Arkaysia</span>, a founder with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Years in <span class="highlight">business operations and management</span> at high levels.</li>
        <li>Hands-on experience in <span class="highlight">restaurants, retail, grocery, hardware, and construction</span>.</li>
        <li>A background in <span class="highlight">data analytics, systems thinking, and AI-assisted development</span>.</li>
        <li>Real history being in the shoes of the <span class="highlight">owner, manager, cook, cashier, and contractor</span>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="callout">
        That means your system isn’t just “coded.” It’s <span class="highlight">designed</span> with someone
        who understands margins, rush hours, staff issues, vendors, and how real-world businesses actually work.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- A_LABS vs Gig Devs -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2><span class="icon">🧩</span> What About the Cheaper Developers Online?</h2>
      <p class="tagline">
        You’ve probably seen offers online promising complete systems for $700–$3,000. Here’s what those usually are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of those offers are based on <span class="highlight">prebuilt scripts</span> that were built once, then
        installed and re-sold many times. That’s why they can offer “hotel + restaurant + HRM + reports” so cheaply:
        the core system is already written.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s nothing wrong with that if all you need is “something basic that kind of fits.” But usually:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The system is designed for a generic business, not your specific deli, salon, or shop.</li>
        <li>Changing how it works can be difficult or impossible without rewriting big parts of it.</li>
        <li>Support can disappear once the gig is marked complete.</li>
        <li>You don’t always know how your data is stored, or how secure it is.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="callout">
        If that’s all you need, those options may be fine.  
        A_LABS is for owners who want something <span class="highlight">built around their business</span>, not the other way around.

    <!-- A_LABS vs Agencies -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2><span class="icon">🏢</span> What About Hiring a Big Agency?</h2>
      <p class="tagline">
        Agencies are great when you’re a funded startup or a larger company. For a small business, they’re often overkill.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Agencies bring in full teams — which is great, but you pay for every layer.</li>
        <li>Project minimums in NYC often start around $15k and climb quickly.</li>
        <li>Their process is optimized for bigger clients, not a single neighborhood shop.</li>
        <li>You may end up paying for features and polish that you don’t actually need yet.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A_LABS gives you the same level of systems thinking, but focused on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What gets your line moving faster.</li>
        <li>What gets more students or walk-ins to come back.</li>
        <li>What reduces mistakes and lost tickets.</li>
        <li>What helps you understand what’s actually selling and when.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Pricing Philosophy -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2><span class="icon">💳</span> How A_LABS Prices Projects</h2>
      <p class="tagline">
        No tricks, no mystery “enterprise tiers.” Just a clear range and a build that matches it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most full systems for small food and retail businesses land in the
        <span class="highlight">$6,000–$8,500</span> range for the build, plus a monthly support plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        That usually covers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A custom system designed around your workflow.</li>
        <li>Online ordering or booking flows.</li>
        <li>Menu or service management tools.</li>
        <li>Basic analytics (what’s selling, when).</li>
        <li>Connections to tools you already use (like payment processors).</li>
        <li>Training for you and your staff.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        From there, we agree on a monthly support plan that fits what you actually need, often in the
        <span class="highlight">$250–$350/month</span> range.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        The exact number is decided with you, based on your priorities and your budget — not just what a spreadsheet says you “should” pay.
