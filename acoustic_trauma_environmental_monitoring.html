  <h1>Environmental and Acoustic Testing Requirements </h1>

  <blockquote>
    Due to the complexity, inconsistency and the array of the disturbances affecting the home, we are requesting a comprehensive environmental and acoustic monitoring protocol to be conducted over a minimum period of 30 consecutive days.
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Focus on SBS and Structural Resonance:</h3>

  <p>
    The testing scope must specifically address the potential presence of <strong>Sick Building Syndrome (SBS)</strong> and <strong>structural resonance</strong> phenomena, both of which may be exacerbating or directly contributing to the occupant's medical symptoms. These evaluations should assess whether the home structure is amplifying low-frequency sound through mechanical or architectural transmission pathways, including shared walls, ceiling/floor joists, or improperly isolated soundproofing from the adjacent building.
    <br><br>
    These inspections should be conducted by third party experts who specialize in structural-vibrations or the appropriate fields:

  </p>

  <h3>Noise Monitoring:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>At least two monitoring units to be deployed: one in the client's bedroom and one in the mother's bedroom.</li>
    <li>Monitoring must capture at least, both dB(A) and dB(C) sound levels and be continuous (24/7), without interruption, with audio, and with a frequency spectrum analysis report focused on low frequency noise.</li>
    <li>30 day noise monitoring, in order to capture realistic environmental conditions, for one during church sessions(most intense on Sundays), which coincide with heightened HVAC operation(mainly at night and during sessions depending on the weather), acoustic activity, and internal pressure fluctuations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Environmental Monitoring:</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>In addition to acoustic data, the monitoring must include indoor environmental sampling, with particular attention to CO₂ spikes, humidity shifts, air pressure anomalies, and signs of mechanical system strain or stagnation related to the shared HVAC infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Elevated CO₂ levels have already been observed by the occupant and may be contributing to symptoms such as headaches, nausea, fatigue, and cognitive difficulty. This must be evaluated alongside structural noise and vibrational impact.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Discretionary Protocol:</h3>
  <p>
    The adjoining property (church) is already aware of the ongoing situation and has made prior attempts to modify their soundproofing and building systems multiple times after their initial installation. There is a credible risk that they may attempt to once again alter, suppress, or disable equipment (such as HVAC systems or amplified sound) during known inspection windows in order to manipulate test results. However, if the inspections are conducted discretely at certain times(mainly overnight, or covertly during their sessions), the intensity of the structural resonance can be felt more prominently during their natural course of operation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, it is essential that this evaluation be conducted with discretion and without advanced notice to the church, any other entities creating unreasonable noise, or third-party actors. Any inspections, measurements, or monitoring should be installed and initiated prior to notifying the church or engaging in formal outreach, in order to document the property in its natural, operational state and ensure the integrity of the findings for as long as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    A short, limited, or compromised inspection would fail to capture the true cause and conditions contributing to the client's worsening health, and would misrepresent the extent of the environmental hazard impacting the residence.
