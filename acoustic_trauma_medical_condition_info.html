  <h2>Hyperacusis</h2>
  <p>
    Hyperacusis is a condition where everyday sounds feel painfully loud or physically uncomfortable—even if they're normal volume to others. It's not just about volume; it's about the brain's overreaction to sound. For someone with hyperacusis, things like low-frequency bass, traffic, or even voices can cause sharp discomfort, dizziness, or nausea. My environmental triggers include vibrations from bass, power tools, engines, and voices—especially low frequencies below 200 Hz.

    <h4>Hyperacusis - Impact and Development</h4>
    <p>
        Hyperacusis isn't like regular hearing loss. It's not just about hearing things louder—it's about the brain misfiring and treating everyday sounds as physical threats. Normal audiological tests often miss it because it's not about volume thresholds, but how sound is processed neurologically. People don't “get used to it” or “tough it out.” For someone like me, the hum of a voice or distant bass can trigger real physical symptoms: headaches, nausea, dizziness, pressure in the ears. The condition is widely reported to develop from noise trauma, especially prolonged exposure to low-frequency sounds, as documented in the NIH-backed research from the International Conference on Hyperacusis (2018).

        <br><br>In my case, the condition was caused by chronic, unrelenting exposure to extreme bass and low-frequency noise from a church with a live band next door. This exposure went on for years, escalated after 2023, and worsened after the church installed faulty soundproofing that failed to block bass during their testing phase. As the noise intensified, my symptoms became more and more severe, documented through sound recordings, medical visits, and daily logs. What began as discomfort became a life-altering injury—forcing me to isolate myself by driving to quiet places like the woods, wear hearing protection constantly, even at home, avoid speech and social interactions with family and friends, and change course on previous career and family plans.

  <h2>Misophonia</h2>
  <p>
    Misophonia involves emotional reactions like anger, anxiety, or panic when exposed to specific trigger sounds such as chewing, tapping, or repetitive bass pulses. These responses are involuntary and stem from the brain's threat detection system being triggered. I experience severe reactions to certain musical patterns, voices, and environmental rhythms due to this condition.

    <h4>Misophonia - Impact and Development</h4>
    <p>
        Misophonia is not simply being annoyed by noise—it's an intense, involuntary emotional reaction to specific sounds. In my case, this condition developed over time due to prolonged and repetitive exposure to disruptive sounds that were in my environment—particularly the pulsating low-frequency bass being produced from a neighboring church. Although the trigger sounds may vary per individual, my specific trigger sounds and frequencies directly align with the sounds created by the church's operation and music. This can be shown through the various hearing test, specifically a hearing threshhold test for hyperacusis, which identifies trigger sounds and frequencies, which was taken by the doctor who is currently treating me to develop the custom hearing aids, a Dr. Natan Bauman. While misophonia can sometimes occur alongside hyperacusis, its defining trait is the emotional response: anxiety, anger, or panic triggered by sound patterns that others wouldn't even notice. I am further trying to cope with the conditions with a psychotherapist who has experience with trauma patients. 

        <br><br>My timeline shows a clear shift in my nervous system's tolerance over time, marked by feelings of panic and emotional distress when exposed to repetitive sound stimuli. These emotional surges—especially in response to voices, low-end frequencies, and mechanical rhythms—have disrupted my ability to function normally in day-to-day environments, contributing to severe social withdrawal, mental exhaustion, and avoidance behaviors. What used to be tolerable background noise is now perceived as a threat by my nervous system, further compounding my inability now to just do simple everyday tasks.

  <h2>Phonophobia</h2>
  <p>
    Phonophobia is the fear of sound itself. People with phonophobia might become anxious just anticipating a loud or triggering sound, even in silence. This fear can cause someone to isolate, avoid public places, or feel on edge constantly. Combined with hyperacusis and misophonia, it results in a constant state of mental strain and isolation.

    <h4>Phonophobia - Impact and Development</h4>
    <p>
        Unlike generalized anxiety disorders or trauma-induced hypervigilance, phonophobia is specifically tied to the expectation of sound—especially sounds known to have caused harm in the past. This means that even in silence, a person may feel unsafe, on edge, or unable to concentrate, fearing a sudden bass hit, a voice spike, or another traumatic noise event. This condition is often comorbid with hyperacusis and misophonia but stands on its own as a distinct, disabling condition.

        <br><br>In my case, phonophobia developed over time as a result of repeated exposure to severe low-frequency and high-bass noise disturbances from the adjacent church which disrupted multiple facets of my daily life and routine, from sleeping, eating, to studying or simply trying to enjoy entertaining activities in my own room. I believe this trauma was not sudden like a one-time explosion; it was chronic, drawn out across years, worsening each time authorities failed to intervene, with every session. As documented in the timeline, I began to anticipate these sonic attacks with dread—specifically noting anxiety spikes before weekend or evening sessions, even when no sound had yet occurred. This constant fear translated into insomnia, physical tension, heart palpitations, and social withdrawal. Events like the return of church sessions, soundproofing failures, or a new group playing bass in a slightly different pattern were all enough to set off hours-long anxiety spirals, nausea, and dizziness—classic signs of phonophobia. The fear of sound became so debilitating that I began avoiding everyday activities, refusing social visits, and preemptively using ear protection even in quieter settings, just to protect my auditory state from further abuse.

        <br><br>Phonophobia, in this context, is not just a mental response—it's a survival mechanism developed from repeated trauma that rewired my sensory processing due to the constant and excessive sounds being forced into my home produced from the church constantly triggering my fight or flight instincts while I am in states of defenselessness such as during sleep. It's also more of a fear of injury, based on real, documented harm.

  <h2>Tinnitus Attacks</h2>
  <p>
    Unlike regular tinnitus, which causes a steady ringing in the ears, tinnitus attacks are episodic and often triggered by environmental noise. These sudden, overwhelming waves of internal sound are disorienting, painful, and disabling. Mr. Arkaysia experiences these in response to pulsing bass and low-frequency sound, often leaving him incapacitated for hours.

    <h4>Tinnitus Attacks - Impact and Development</h4>
    <p>
        Tinnitus attacks are not the same as general tinnitus. Traditional tinnitus is often described as a constant or intermittent ringing or buzzing in the ears. However, tinnitus attacks are sudden, intense episodes triggered by environmental factors—especially trigger sound exposure—causing overwhelming internal auditory sensations that can be painful, disorienting, and incapacitating. These attacks are not subtle—they hijack the nervous system and often come with secondary symptoms such as vertigo, nausea, pressure in the head, confusion, and emotional panic.

        <br><br>In my case, tinnitus attacks are triggered primarily by low-frequency bass and sub-bass vibrations, which remain present in my home despite attempted soundproofing. Based on my documented timeline and doctor visits, these attacks became more frequent and severe after prolonged exposure to noise from the church and bar—especially when the church installed faulty soundproofing that dampened higher frequencies but allowed damaging low-frequency sounds to pass through. These episodes do not just cause discomfort; they make it incredibly difficult to carry out normal functions. As documented repeatedly throughout the timeline, I experience days of exhaustion, pressure in the ears, nausea, and cognitive fog after such attacks. Some attacks leave me unable to concentrate, complete tasks, or even walk normally due to loss of balance and spatial orientation. There are instances where just the anticipation of exposure would trigger symptoms—highlighting how this condition overlaps with phonophobia and anxiety-induced vestibular dysfunction.

        <br><br>These are not psychosomatic events—they are physiologically and neurologically driven and induced reactions to chronic injury and overstimulation of the auditory system which are now being triggered constantly in my daily life. The impact on my everyday life of all the conditions combined is severe and disabling, with attacks and symptoms disrupting sleep, and cognitive function. This significantly limits my ability to work, socialize, and care for my family—consequences that are now long-term and well-documented.
