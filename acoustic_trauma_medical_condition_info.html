  <h2>Hyperacusis</h2>
  <p>
    Hyperacusis is a condition where normal sounds—such as traffic, voices, or low-frequency bass—are perceived as painfully loud or physically uncomfortable. It's not just volume that causes discomfort, but the brain's overreaction to sound stimuli. 
    For Mr. Arkaysia, this means things like church drums or basslines trigger nausea, headaches, and disorientation, making daily life unmanageable.

  <h2>Misophonia</h2>
  <p>
    Misophonia involves emotional reactions like anger, anxiety, or panic when exposed to specific trigger sounds such as chewing, tapping, or repetitive bass pulses. These responses are involuntary and stem from the brain’s threat detection system being triggered. 
    Mr. Arkaysia experiences severe reactions to certain musical patterns, voices, and environmental rhythms due to this condition.

  <h2>Phonophobia</h2>
  <p>
    Phonophobia is a fear or anxiety of sound, often anticipating that a noise might occur. It may lead to extreme distress even in quiet environments due to fear of sound exposure. Combined with hyperacusis and misophonia, it results in a constant state of mental strain and isolation.

  <h2>Tinnitus Attacks</h2>
  <p>
    Unlike regular tinnitus, which causes a steady ringing in the ears, tinnitus attacks are episodic and often triggered by environmental noise. These sudden, overwhelming waves of internal sound are disorienting, painful, and disabling. Mr. Arkaysia experiences these in response to pulsing bass and low-frequency sound, often leaving him incapacitated for hours.
