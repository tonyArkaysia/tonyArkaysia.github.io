<h1>Acoustic Trauma & Noise Nuisance – Legal Chronology</h1>

<div class="timeline">

  <div class="event">
    <h2>2006–2018 – Excessive Sound Levels</h2>
    <p>Church buys the property and gradually increases noise levels over the years. Starts with quiet prayer sessions → adds choir → microphone & speakers → live band with full instrumentals and concert stage (drums, guitar, piano).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h2>April 2021 – Post-COVID Escalation</h2>
    <p>I return home to care for my elderly parents and notice a major escalation. Sessions now last 4–6 hours almost daily, disrupting health and well-being. Music sessions feature drum-dominant songs, akin to rock music. Father recovering from serious lung illness; I’m transitioning careers into data programming work. I verbally notify my landlord, who acknowledges the problem but takes no direct action.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h2>2021 – NYPD Warnings & Sewing Machine Issue</h2>
    <p>Multiple NYPD complaints filed; noise levels repeatedly exceed legal limits (Exhibits i3 & i4). July 2021: landlord’s sewing machine use increases in daytime. When I raise the issue, landlord deflects. I temporarily set it aside to focus on church noise.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h2>October 2021 – DOB Violations</h2>
    <p>Contact DOB for possible illegal conversion. Partial Vacate Order issued on the church for unrelated violations; they remain closed for approx. one year. (<a href="https://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/ECBQueryByLocationServlet?requestid=7&allbin=4045623" target="_blank">NYC Buildings record</a>)</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h2>2023 – Issue Resumes & Escalation</h2>
    <p>Church reopens; noise resumes at full volume. Multiple verbal warnings issued to Pastor, his son, and brother-in-law (Exhibits i1 & i2). Multiple 311 complaints filed. NYPD warnings by Officers Motato and Fuentes (Exhibits i11). DEP faulty inspection claims no jurisdiction. MEND Mediation fails (Exhibit i6). Legal notice sent, signed by me, my uncle, and my mother. Noise worsens with overlap of sewing machine, bar, and church. Begin tinnitus attacks, medical testing, and purchase of sound meters and recording equipment (advised by David Smith of Sound Testimony).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h2>March 2024 – DEP Re-Contacted</h2>
    <p>Requested second inspection; DEP finds excessive noise and issues fines (Exhibit i5). Church continues noise before soundproofing is installed.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h2>May 2024 – Faulty Soundproofing</h2>
    <p>Church installs improper soundproofing. Structure resonates with low-frequency vibrations. Landlord notified of hearing/health issues; no action taken. Landlord denies vibration issues.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h2>June–July 2024 – Witness Reports</h2>
    <p>Symptoms worsen. DEP refuses new inspection until September. Low frequencies suspected from heavy machinery. Landlord notified again of my diagnosed permanent hearing condition; no action taken.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h2>Aug–Sept 2024 – Seeking Relief & Medical Assistance</h2>
    <p>I drive to remote areas for relief. Symptoms worsen: headaches, tinnitus, shortness of breath. Doctors confirm permanent condition. Notice church staff turn off HVAC after I bang on wall.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h2>October 2024 – Medical & Soundproofing Adjustments</h2>
    <p>Consult with Dr. Adams (tinnitus specialist) who refers me to Dr. Natan Bauman. Church reconstructs wall; faulty triple-leaf effect suspected. Adjustments lessen but do not remove vibrations.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h2>November 2024 – Dr. Bauman Specialist Evaluation</h2>
    <p>Initial evaluation confirms hyperacusis, tinnitus, and phonophobia. Treatment plan with therapy and custom devices. Follow-up set for Dec 31, 2024. Travel arranged to hotel with soundproofed room.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h2>December 31, 2024 – Evaluation & Healing Therapy</h2>
    <p>Dr. Bauman conducts advanced tests; identifies octave band thresholds. Begins retraining therapy. States recovery is uncertain but possible for coping.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h2>January 2025 – Retraining Therapy Effects</h2>
    <p>Temporary health improvements when away from home; symptoms return immediately upon return.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h2>February 2025 – Environmental Changes</h2>
    <p>Church adjusts soundproofing; high-volume music reduced, but low-frequency resonance persists. Health somewhat improved. Began weekly therapy with Madeleine White. Retain lawyer for landlord notice.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h2>Feb–May 2025 – Noise Still Relentless</h2>
    <p>Church sessions remain excessive, with abnormal low-frequency resonance. Bar continues despite warnings. Landlady still uses sewing machine daily despite notices. No landlord action taken.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h2>July 2025 – HP Action Filed</h2>
    <p>After lawyer notice and landlord denial, proceed with HP Action. July 22: HPD inspection retains my statement.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h2>August 11, 2025 – Housing Court Date</h2>
    <p>Case scheduled to address hazardous conditions, landlord inaction, and request for relief.</p>
  </div>
