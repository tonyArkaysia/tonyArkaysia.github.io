You can hear the drums and bass are the most prominent and create warping sounds in the room from the reverberation at times. At approximately 7 minutes and 20 seconds in, you can hear the bass buzzing and this is another one of the harmful trigger sounds which has led to my hearing conditions.

The video starts off with the session already underway, approximately 14 minutes in. In this recording, I begin with a calibration process of the sound meters as usual, as well as syncing up all the devices. This is the standard procedure I go through before every recording with this complete set up of 2 meters, sound tablet and a video recording. This is a Tuesday evening session, after notifying the establishment for over a year and a half of the bass noise. The video helps display the sound levels of music sessions, the amount of times they played music, then switched to speeches. The sound levels of the speeches, which can be heard clear enough to make out the speech at times. We can also see on the Decibel X app and two sound meters, the frequencies that are traveling over and causing the highest sound levels are the low frequency sounds from their music or speech. </td>
        <td>This video should help establish the sound levels after multiple notifications, after personal visits, police visits, two DEP visits and MEND mediation. At this point, the church can be heard still at excessive level in my mother's bedroom. These were sound levels we were exposed to every week, several days a week(4-6 days), for multiple hours a day(4-8 hours). </td>

        <td>This recording was made after the church received noise violations from the DEP and had just made their first attempt at installing soundproofing. The video captures a Tuesday evening session, with the main event starting at 7:30 P.M. At approximately 7:30:30 P.M., the speaker activates with a low, humming bassline. They would sometimes leave this humming bassline on for hours and in between practice sessions and event sessions, further contributing to the lengthy exposure to low frequency sounds being produced in my home. These are some of the triggering sounds I now experience at excessive volume—mainly drums and bass, all under 200 Hz, which are especially damaging to hearing. The choir is noticeably quieter compared to previous recordings, as the soundproofing has muffled the higher frequencies, but had little to no effect on the low frequencies. This demonstrates how the changes made were ineffective at reducing the most harmful components of the noise.</td>
