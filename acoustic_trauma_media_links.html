  <h4>Please note: It is best to listen to the video and audio recordings with a quality headset, earbuds, airpods, etc. This is to ensure you will be able to hear all the lower frequency & bass sounds in the videos, that a laptop or regular tv speaker might not be able to produce. These are sounds around and under the 120hz range. </h4><h5>This page is still a work in progress and I am working on adding more relevant media files. This case was initially documented as an on-going nuisance I thought I might have to be taking to court myself, which has now turned into a construction defect/personal injury.</h5>

In this recording, I begin with a calibration process of the sound meters as usual, as well as syncing up all the devices. This is the standard procedure I go through before every recording with this complete set up of 2 meters, sound tablet and a video recording. This is a Tuesday evening session, after notifying the establishment for over a year and a half of the bass noise. The video helps display the sound levels of music sessions, the amount of times they played music, then switched to speeches. The sound levels of the speeches, which can be heard clear enough to make out the speech at times. We can also see on the Decibel X app and two sound meters, the frequencies that are traveling over and causing the highest sound levels are the low frequency sounds from their music or speech. </td>

You can hear the sound of the music and their noise is now muffled, however there is a deep bass humming sound at around 20 minutes into the video. This is highlighted as a beam of light, which shows how much louder the frequency is than the rest of the ambient sound in the room. This sound is also another trigger sound at approximately 59hz.</td>
        <td>The church would leave this on, and produce the low humming sound for several weeks within the duration of their installation. I believe the sound is from a combination of sources, however mainly and most prominent when their Central A/C unit on. The unit is placed on the roof of the first floor establishment that extends further out than the rest of the building. I suspect this Central Air Unit, is and caused strong vibrations into the wall and HVAC ducts in the first floor along the wall we share, which was "soundproofed" improperly. This in turn, actually caused and possibly still causes a constant vibration into my house that can be felt in the floor.</td>

        <td>This recording was made after the church received noise violations from the DEP and had just made their first attempt at installing soundproofing. The video captures a Tuesday evening session, with the main event starting at 7:30 P.M. At approximately 7:30:30 P.M., the speaker activates with a low, humming bassline. They would sometimes leave this humming bassline on for hours and in between practice sessions and event sessions, further contributing to the lengthy exposure to low frequency sounds being produced in my home. These are some of the triggering sounds I now experience at excessive volume—mainly drums and bass, all under 200 Hz, which are especially damaging to hearing. The choir is noticeably quieter compared to previous recordings, as the soundproofing has muffled the higher frequencies, but had little to no effect on the low frequencies. This demonstrates how the changes made were ineffective at reducing the most harmful components of the noise.</td>
        <td>This video highlights a clear pattern: despite being issued violations, the church continued operations with ineffective soundproofing. The persistent low-frequency noise shows either a lack of understanding or reckless disregard for the harm being caused.</td>

        <td>The readings show the pattern and behaviour of frequencies under 200hz in my room. It also shows the general sound levels as a whole.</td>
        <td>The video is a zoomed in, and zoomed out view of readings in my room with a spectrum analysis done at 1 A.M. with no other sounds present other than some passing street traffic as shown on the video during the security camera segments. I believe of the pattern and behaviour of the low frequencies are not normal for a residential room, and are indicative of the vibrations I feel. As you can see with the patterns of shooting spikes at specific frequencies around 29Hz, 59Hz, and 117-120Hz being the loudest present sounds in a room with no other noise. 
          
          <br><br>
          29 Hz is in the infrasonic range (below 30 Hz), often associated with large HVAC systems, fans, blowers, or mechanical compressors.
          <br><br>
          29 Hz could also be a resonant frequency of a wall, floor, or structural element—especially with drywall + insulation + QuietRock layers, like the construction materials the church informed me they were using, for the soundproofing they installed.
          <br><br>
          Frequencies in the 20-30 Hz range are known to affect the vestibular system, causing symptoms like nausea, vertigo, pressure in the ears, headaches, dizziness. These match my symptoms described after the church's soundproofing retrofit, especially when combined with hyperacusis or phonotrauma.
