This is live session with the choir and all the equipment turned on, the background sound is my TV in the living room due to the door in my room being open. You can hear the drums and bass are the most prominent and create warping sounds in the room from the reverberation at times. At approximately 7 minutes and 20 seconds in, you can hear the bass buzzing and this is another one of the harmful trigger sounds which has led to my hearing conditions. At approx 13 minutes, 30 seconds in the video, I take the video outside into my living room where you can still hear their music and bass just as prominent from anywhere I am standing in my house.</td>
