    <h1>Direct Correlation of Environmental Vibrations & Medical Condition Summary</h1>

    <p>
      Since returning home in 2021, I personally witnessed the church next door escalate their noise levels from disruptive music to unbearable conditions that severely impacted my health. The real turning point came in May 2024, when they installed a soundproofing wall along our shared structure — without any sound experts or proper consultation.
    </p>


    <p>
      This wall, combined with their existing central HVAC unit on their extension roof, began producing constant low-frequency vibrations — specifically around 29 Hz, 59 Hz, and 117-120 Hz. These vibrations now travel through the shared wall, into my tile flooring, and ultimately dissipate in my bedroom — where I sleep and work.
    </p>


    <p>
      This continuous exposure directly triggered the onset of my hyperacusis, tinnitus, vertigo, and other debilitating symptoms. My situation is backed by a clear timeline of recorded evidence — sound meter readings, videos, and medical records — all aligning with the church's negligent actions and the worsening of my health condition.
