                <p>Key Events:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Church expands music sessions to 4-6 hours per day, now making noise levels unpredictable.</li>
                    <li>I start filing 311 complaints again via online and with calls to the local precinct; initial NYPD responses are ineffective and dismissive.</li>
                    <li>First private interactions with the church—promises to lower volume but no real action taken. I proceed to research the legality of the construction of their establishment and permits.</li>
                    <li>Department of Buildings (DOB) issues a Partial Vacate Order due to illegal church modifications and conversion along with multiple violations such as a lack of a Place of Assembly certification after operating over the past 10+ years.</li>

                <div class="marker"></div>
                <h3>Government Involvement & Church Non-Compliance (2023 - Early 2024)</h3>
                <p>Key Events:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Church reopens a year after the partial vacate order and actually increases noise intensity .</li>
                    <li>I begin filing 311 complaints again. Police continue to provide inconsistent responses, sometimes claiming the church is "allowed to play music". Also stating they "can't do anything" or "can't really do much" after witnessing the sound levels in my home.</li>
                    <li>I am able to finally reach the DEP. The first DEP inspection occurs—finds noise violations but takes no significant enforcement action. Inspector Reynoso clearly states, they have "no jurisdisction" over the Church, and this is all they can do. The Inspector actually informs the church of this as well, letting them know they are over the limit, but he has no authority.</li>
                    <li>Mediation attempts through MEND fail; church does not follow through on any promises, or even attempt turning the music down to an acceptable level.</li>                    
                    <li>The bar also begins excessively playing music adding to the excessive exposure to low frequency sounds at excessive levels which prompts me to begin filing 311 complaints on almost every occasion as the music grew louder and louder.</li>
                    <li>My aunt-in-law starts sewing more and more often, and the sewing machine is left on for several hours a day, 5-6 days a week now.</li>
                    <li>I start filing complaints more and more hoping for any relief in regards to the Church, and now the bar as well after the Summer of 2023, again with little to no police response even for the bar, citing the same statements, "they're allowed to play music", with no responses ever to my follow up questions in regards to the sound levels allowed though. At the very least this is a clear sign the police blindly defended the church without the proper investigation.</li>
                    <li>This precinct then reaches out and offered little to no help again really. After this occurrence, the lack of police responses grew even bolder and more blatant, with police dimissing the tickets without any visit or investigations almost immediately after filing now.</li>
                    <li>I continue informing the church of their sound issues and other issues persisting, with letters, emails and verbal communications until the end of the summer.</li>
                    <li>In early 2024, I grow tired of the Police's inability and notify the bar of the excessive sound levels and what I believe is wrong with their set up, through three personal visits verbally, as well as a letter to the owner and for management, which I also translated into Spanish for them.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>DEP reports confirming noise inspection scheduled and sound levels being excessive.</li>
                        <li>Records of police continuing to dismiss noise complaints against the bar, can be found on 311 OpenData. There's a pattern of them finding "no evidence" to "fixed the condition" for over the span of over a year or two, without escalating the issue properly to the DEP.</li>
                        <li>MEND mediation email records showing lack of compliance and video documentation shows sound levels consistently excessive throughout the process.</li>
                        <li>A complaint was made through Internal Affairs and CCRB in regards to the NYPD's lack of response and dismissive actions. </li>
                        <li>Records of the communications with the Bar</li>

                <p>Key Events:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Church installs soundproofing after I was finally able to call for a surprise DEP inspection through channels outside of the NYPD, unfortunately, it doesn't work properly and increases low-frequency noise exposure and begins to affect my health.</li>
                    <li>Health deteriorates significantly—hyperacusis, tinnitus, dizziness, vertigo, nausea intensify within the two weeks the church installs their soundproofing and continues to do so afterwards indefinitely.</li>
                    <li>Multiple doctor visits confirm hearing conditions and sound-induced health issues.</li>

                        <li>Video, Audio, and Sound meter recordings showing continued excessive noise levels.</li>
                        <li>Recordings are done while I am experiencing the symptoms such as excessively burping for hours due to the exposure, and in ways document my health conditions and the decline or progress.</li>

                <h3>Present Day: Ongoing Issues & Legal Preparation (Late 2024 - 2025)</h3>
                <p>Key Events:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Police still refuse to properly enforce noise laws against the bar, and adamantly defend the bar upon complaints and local calls to the precinct. The police still have mixed responses on how they respond to noise complaints, all roads essentially leading to a deflection to another department or simply telling me to 'move'.</li>
                    <li>DEP continues delaying inspections or scheduling them at ineffective times. This is despite me writing several emails to the commissioner through DEP corresponsdence informing them of the entire issue, as well as my health conditions I'm suffering with due to these noises. </li>
                    <li>Church noise still excessive despite supposed attempts to soundproofing fixes throughout the rest of the summer of 2024 to now currently. They are trying to fix the issue before the DOB comes to check because they never had any construction permits to authorize the soundproofing installed.</li>
