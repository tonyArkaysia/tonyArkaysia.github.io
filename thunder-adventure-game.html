The screen flashes red: "PROJECT TERMINATION INITIATED. ALL SUBJECTS BEING RELEASED."

The lights throughout the arena flicker and die. Emergency lighting kicks in. On the monitors, you see the alien staff collapse like puppets with their strings cut. The spaceship above becomes visible as its cloaking fails, and it begins to retreat into the night sky.

The door bursts open. Shai staggers in, looking exhausted but human.

"You did it," he breathes. "I can feel it. Whatever they had in our heads... it's gone."

Outside, you hear sirens. Someone called the police.

"You have to go," Shai says. "If they find you here, you'll spend years being debriefed. But I'll back up your story. We all will."

"All?"

"Everyone they tried to convert. We remember everything now. The Thunder are going to have one hell of a press conference tomorrow."

He grins. "And you, Quinn? You just saved professional basketball from an alien invasion. That's one hell of a story."

You saved the day, became an overnight sensation, and proved that sometimes the craziest stories are the true ones.
