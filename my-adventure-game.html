            Our story begins in a Queens apartment on a Monday afternoon at around 12:30pm on the last week of school. You and your friends have just graduated from Junior High School. Despite missing much of your senior year due to your parents' disappearance and being frequently excused after failing to show up, you still managed to graduate.

            However, you hadn't applied to any preferred high schools before your parents vanished. Fortunately, they had previously updated your legal address to that of a family friend's, conveniently close to a superior high school. This move, coupled with alittle document forgery, ensured your acceptance into Forest Hills High School as your designated local school.

            You arrive home, and immediately greet your pet dog "ROXY". You make sure she has eaten her food from this morning, clean her bowl and immediately grab a few very key personal items and grab her leash and head out together to the local Bodega to meet your friends. As you get downstairs, you hear your land lady outside sweeping and decide to head back around to into your apartment and out the side to avoid being seen in the daytime, and avoid a nagging, since you are suppose to be in school. As you head through the back, your backyard is attached to a forest, however, does have a 6 foot fence you have to climb, which you do easily after gently lowering Roxy on the other side first. You unleash Roxy and head through the Forest on the side of the house to avoid the land lady the front of the house, going around and coming behind the doctor's office, which is your best friend JOSEPHINE'S house. You climb up the trash dumpster and the piping to reach the fire escape and third floor window to see if she's home in her room, however it appears she has already left after not answering your calls from outside the window. You reach the intersection with Roxy, you put your headphones on and jet down the busy street and absorb the daytime vibes of Corona Avenue, fresh with vibrant diverse culture, there's almost a store or restaurant for every country around the world in this little, not so quiet neighborhood of Queens. It's central location in the Borough makes it an urban hub and hot spot of all sorts and for all walks of life from around the world. However, because of the crowdedness and a dense population of lower income properties, there is a decent amount of crime and illegal activities in the area which still remain a big issue.
