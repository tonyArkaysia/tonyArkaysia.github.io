      <h2>1️⃣ Early Noise Issues & Government Involvement (2006 - 2021)</h2>
      <div class="entry"><strong>2006-2012:<span class="tag-event">Excessive Sound Levels</span></strong> <span>Church buys the property and gradually increases noise. Starting from quiet prayer sessions, to adding a choir, microphone & speakers, and then a live band with full instrumentals(drums, guitar, piano).</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>2010-2012:<span class="tag-event">Excessive Sound Levels</span></strong> <span>Second church group joins the venue, adding more frequent sessions bringing even louder music with a more predominant use of drums. Sessions were held every weekend from 7-8 A.M.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>2012-2018:<span class="tag-notice">Notice by Authorities</span></strong> <span>Noise complaints are filed but relief is temporary; local police are unable to deter the church with notice of neighbor complaints.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>April 2021:<span class="tag-event">Excessive Sound Levels</span></strong> <span>After COVID, I return home to care for my elderly parents and notice major escalation—sessions last 4-6 hours, almost everyday, interfering with my family's health and wellbeing, with my father recovering from a serious illness, and my career switch into data programming.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>July 2021:<span class="tag-notice">Notice via verbal communication</span></strong><span>First direct confrontation with the church—the pastor's son/music teacher acknowledges my complaint and says he'll try to lower the volume. I noticed no changes afterwards whatsoever.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>August 2021:<span class="tag-notice">Notice by Authorites</span></strong> <span>NYPD Officer Luis Motato from the 110th precinct gives first official verbal notice since the complaints years ago in the past, but noise persists.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>October 2021:<span class="tag-violation">DOB Violations</span></strong> <span>After months of no changes. Contacted DOB for possible illegal conversion, resulting in Partial Vacate Order for a year & multiple violations.</span></div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2️⃣ The Church's Non-Compliance & First Health Impacts (2022 - 2023)</h2>
      <div class="entry"><strong>2022:</strong> <span>Church temporarily shuts down due to DOB violations, I am able to continue building skills necessary for my career.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>November-December 2022:<span class="tag-event">Excessive Sound Levels</span></strong><span>Church reopens, noise immediately returns to pre-closure levels.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>January 2023:</strong><span>I resume filing 311 complaints after waiting for them to adjust.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>February 2023:<span class="tag-notice">Notice</span></strong> <span>Serious verbal notice to the church, warning them legal action is possible.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>March 2023:<span class="tag-notice">Notice</span></strong> <span>Officer Fuentes, the Neighborhood Coordinator from the local 110th precinct visits my house and witnesses the disturbance first hand. He informs me he cannot issue any violations and the sound meters they had were currently unavailable and being used at parks for loud cars. The officer stated he can only notify the church, in which then the officer informs the church about neighbor complaints and excessive noise.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>March 2023:</strong> <span>Church makes minor sound adjustments but bass still leaks, and eventually they continued to operate at excessive sound levels.</div>
      <div class="entry"><div><strong>April 2023:<span class="tag-notice">Notice</span><span class="tag-violation">Violations</span></strong><span>First DEP visit, finds sound levels in violation but is unable to issue penalties, with Inspector Reynoso stating that the DEP has no jurisdiction over the church, but will notify the church of the excessive noise levels and disturbance. The church confirms this later on during our MEND mediation, including the part about the inspector not having any authority to issue them violations.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>June 2023:</strong><span>Mediation begins, church only makes minor ineffective changes, resulting in a failed mediation.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>July 2023:<span class="tag-notice">Notice</span></strong><span>Mediation ends, church continues operating at the same excessive levels. My landlord and I send a letter with certified mail to the church in regards to pursuing serious legal action.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>October 2023:</strong> <span>I contact a digital sound forensics expert David Smith from Sound Testimony in regards documenting my case. He offered through consultation, advice on recording methods and recording equipment.</span></div>

Health deteriorates—anxiety, tinnitus attacks and symptoms worsen. I begin consulting my doctor about increasing tinnitus attacks, and symptoms of anxiety. Dr. Jagat Rawal, issues a referral for an ENT specialist, and a Psychologist.</span></div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3️⃣ Unrelenting Noise Exposure (Late 2023 - Early 2024)</h2>
      <div class="entry"><strong>January 2024:<span class="tag-medevent">Medical Diagnosis</span></strong> <span>First ENT visit with Dr. Allan Levin → Informed the doctor of high pitched sounds in ears and lack of full hearing. Diagnosed with tinnitus.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>January 2024:<span class="tag-medevent">Medical Testing & Diagnosis</span></strong> <span>A standard hearing test with audiologist Dr. Zarina Naizam. Informed the doctor of tinnitus attacks, lack of aural fullness from loud church music. The hearing test showed my "hearing is fine" as qouted by the doctor, but only tested for hearing loss, and not hearing sensitivity(LDL Test).</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>February 2024:</strong> <span>Community Board outreach → No response.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>March 2024:</strong> <span>Second DEP visit → sound levels 20 decibels over the violation limit found, church fined and ordered to a noise mitigation plan which leads the church to install soundproofing.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>May 2024:<span class="tag-medevent">The Trauma Incident</span></strong> <span>Church attempts soundproofing on our shared wall, but improper installation and lack of a sound expert consultation, worsens low-frequency exposure, and begins creating strange waves of vibrations into my entire apartment, and can be felt through my floor.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>June 2024:<span class="tag-medevent">Severe Medical Health Crisis</span><span class="tag-notice">Notice of health effects.</span></strong> <span>Severe health crisis → nausea, dizziness, vertigo, induced heart-rate, short breathing patterns, brain fog, tinnitus attacks, and inability to stay near low-frequency sounds. I notify the church, directly informing them of the symptoms me and my mother have been experiencing, and show them my readings of strange low frequency vibrations and letting them know I suspect it is from the Central A/C unit located visibly on the roof of their first floor extension. The pastor's son disagrees and stated everything was done properly, and there was no HVAC system on the roof, although it could still be seen, visibly operating.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>June - July 2024:<span class="tag-medevent">Medical Diagnosis</span></strong> <span>After experiencing extremely severe symptoms, I reach out to my doctors again and visit Dr. Allan Levin, ENT specialist. I describe to the doctor my symptoms, particularly about extremely loud sounds, and in a sudden realization and almost shock, the doctor diagnoses me with "Acoustic PhonoTrauma". He then apologizes and tells me he cannot treat me, and informs me to seek a second opinion. </span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>June - July 2024:<span class="tag-medevent">Medical Testing & Diagnosis</span></strong> <span>Seeking further medical advice, I visit Dr. Stephen Warman, another ENT specialist. The doctor issues a hearing test conducted by audiologist, Dr. Vasilia Meskouris, who does conduct a loudness threshold test and finds my hearing sensitivity to be lower for someone my age. It's important to note, this test did not include sounds under 200hz, which is in the range of which my trigger sounds fall. Dr. Stephen Warman, also issued an MRI for my inner ear in case due to my symptoms of brain fog, loss of balance and reduced cognitive function. In the end, he confirms the diagnosis of Hyperacusis and Tinnitus. He states the same as Dr. Levin, and informs me the condition is permanent and there is no cure. The advice of the doctor was to "avoid noise". He did refer me to possibly seek treatment with a Dr. Sean Mcmenomey at NYU Langone. </span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>July 2024:<span class="tag-medevent">Medical Diagnosis & Referral</span></strong> <span>Dr. Sean Mcmenomey confirms Hyperacusis, and Tinnitus diagnosis, but is still unable to offer any kind of cure or treatment. The doctor refers me to a Hyperacusis specialist, a Dr. Susan E. Adams. I attempt to contact Dr. Adams immediately, however I reach her assistant who informs me the initial consulation is 15 mins and free, however, further evaluation would be costly and not covered by any insurance. The treatment was approximately $5500 to start with the equipment and on-going therapy sessions could be around $200-$300 an hour after the inital 6 months. As I didnt have the money for the treatment right away, I began finding other ways to cope in the meantime. </span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>August - September 2024:<span class="tag-medevent">Health & Trauma Coping Strategies</span></strong> <span>For the remainder of the summer, I experience extreme and horrible health symptoms daily, and resort to traveling far out of the city, only able to return at night when all the sounds and vibrations have calmed. This was a very difficult time with a plethora of uncertainties lying ahead.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>October 2024:<span class="tag-medevent">Medical Consultation and Diagnosis</span></strong> <span>Dr. Susan E. Adams diagnoses Hyperacusis, Tinnitus, and suspects a condition called Misophonia via phone consultation; refers me to a Dr. Natan Bauman.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>November 2024:<span class="tag-medevent">Medical Consultation</span></strong> <span>During our first consultation, Dr. Bauman pre-diagnoses me with Hyperacusis, Misophonia, Phonophobia; orders more tests and custom hearing aids to be ready.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>December 31, 2024:<span class="tag-medevent">Medical Testing, Evaluation, and Diagnosis.</span></strong> <span>Dr. Bauman conducts several hearing tests and programs the custom hearing aids for my specific conditions in a 5 hour visit. He officially diagnoses me with Hyperacusis, Misophonia, Phonophobia, and Tinnitus.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>January 1, 2025:<span class="tag-medevent">Treatment and Therapy Training Begins.</span></strong> <span>I begin the treatment and therapy retraining process as well as continue to seek help from the authorities as well as legal counsel. After leaving my home for a few days for the doctor visit in Connecticut, I notice a drastic change in my health for the better. I felt I was able to breathe slightly better, my heart was beating alittle bit more normal, and my mind was more clear. The headaches subsided, and the burping stopped. Unfortunately, this didn't last for long as the symptoms came right back when I returned home. I struggled with retraining and was still unable to stay in my home.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>January 16, 2025:<span class="tag-medevent">More Construction.</span></strong> <span>Approximately 11:00PM, I notice the some construction sounds from the church. I then hear drilling, hammering, etc, on the wall we share. I document the incident as file a request for an update for an inspection on their faulty soundproofing. After this incident, I felt the vibrations and sounds in the house change with less intensity, however still constant and present. The inspection by the DOB isn't conducted until months later, and is miscommunicated, with the inspector not mentioning anything about the soundproofing wall, and checked for other past alterations prior to the soundproofing on our shared wall. After they finally update the report, I file another inspection request later in April, this time for the inspector to also visit our house and side of the building.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>February 2025:<span class="tag-medevent">Additional Support.</span></strong> <span>After struggling with the treatment and therapy retraining process but being able to deal with the issue slightly better(I suspect this is due to their adjustments on January 16, 2025), I reach out for further help to cope with the stress, with a psychotherapist who specializes with trauma patients, a Madeleine White LMSW. Miss White has helped with executing a variety of grounding techniques, coping mechanisms, and other therapeutic methods to not only deal with the sound trauma, but the heavy amount of stress and life changing issues, that my family and I now have to possibly deal with for the rest of our lives.</span></div>
      <div class="entry"><strong>April 18, 2025:<span class="tag-medevent">More Drilling.</span></strong> <span>After filing multiple complaints with the DOB in regards to obtaining an inspection for illegal alteration. The church makes more attempts to 'fix' the issue and can be heard drilling on the shared wall again. This again, adjusts the way sounds are being heard in my room, and in the house as well.</span></div>
