The sessions last much longer (four to six hours vs. 10-15 minutes).

As well as their other usual disruptive sessions, and practices, which were also extremely lengthy. Further disrupting my ability to fully focus learning an entirely new career and relinquishes me to have to spend a lot extra time later going over the work, now without the resources and live support that was available to me, and which I paid for, during the class hours. My dad continues to struggle to rest and recover, my mom is exposed as frequently as I am, and is also closer to the source. She informs me its gotten bad to the point where her picture frames hung in her room have fallen off and broken at times. I begin thinking about and planning how to take my parents with me to California, and away from this. But in the meantime, I was going to speak with the church in case my parents wanted to stay in New York where all our family and friends are, and regardless to fix this ongoing issue that has now gotten much worse, for my parents, myself and my grand uncle if he has any other tenants move in after.</em></p>"

However, when I returned home in 2021, they now had a different sound system or turned it up, and they played much much longer and still start as early as 7:30am. I am using an app called \"Sound Meter\" which isn't as fully featured and detailed as the other apps I later discover. However, the app displays an estimated reading along with the audio from the video. It should clearly show how loud they are since the sound is recorded from inside my house with the windows initially closed. The video starts off with the session already underway and with mostly the drumming and low frequency bass sounds, that are actually the trigger sounds that eventually led to my hearing and other health conditions. After about 3 minutes, you can hear only the drums still continue while the other instruments and fade out and come back at around 7 minutes to the end of the video. At around 22 minutes, you can also see me bring the phone to the window and you can also get an idea of how much sound is being emitted from the front of their property as well. You can also notice how the music is also almost none stop for the entire video, and that is just one segment of their session. The decibel levels reach the high 60's in db(a) measured from inside my home, which means the db(C) which is weighted for the low frequency sounds you hear, should be a decent amount higher, and easily in the 70-80 db(C) range judging by how much louder the lower frequency sounds are here.</strong></p><p><em>You can find the link to the video here. It's important to note that for these videos, you have to be wearing headphones or earbuds. A normal speaker from a tv, your phone or monitor, won't be able to play all the sounds as clearly and the bass sounds and lower frequency sounds wont be audible in the same way as if you were listening to it live. A pair of Samsung Buds or Apple Airpods should do. Decent high quality headphones such as Bose, or Sony should be even better and can actually provide spatial details on where the sound sources are coming from.

This was problematic because, if you\u2019re inspecting noise levels, you shouldn\u2019t warn the source beforehand. Regardless, the music was so loud that he measured it as over the legal limit using a dB(A) weighted scale. I believe a bass measurement using db(C) would have shown them to be even more excessive. During the inspection, Inspector Reynoso commented that his own apartment was louder, which felt biased since he's supposed to enforce the noise code based on legal limits, not personal comparisons. The church was clearly in violation. However, his partner was much more empathetic to what me and my mom were going through, but I believe he was there more to shadow the inspector while still training. Inspector Reynoso then informed me he couldn\u2019t fine the church as he had \"no jurisdiction\" but agreed he would warn them. He let's me know to just contact him again if anything though, but provides no clear way to do so as well as pretty much just telling me he can't really help me anyway.</strong></p><p><em>After Inspector Reynoso's visit, I receive an email from a MEND coordinator which now informs me the church has responded to the mediation request and has agreed to enter into mediation. I sign the MEND \"Consent to Mediate\" form and email the document to Sharon Osbourne on May 12, 2023. Later, during mediation, the church confirmed they received a warning but were also told by the DEP Inspector that he couldn't issue them fines, which in my opinion, allowed them to continue their activities with hardly any adjustments.</em></p>"

On June 18-19, I sent a second email to Caesar, informing him that none of the changes were effective and let him know which specific key factors that were still an issue. I then let him know in order for us to proceed through the mediation, we would have to see some actual changes in the sound level. The church was still unable to make any meaningful adjustments. Around the same time, the bar across the street changed management and began playing extremely loud music especially afterhours, further exacerbating the noise issue and the length of my exposure to low frequency and instrusive sounds. I begin to start filing 311 complaints more often for the Soneros Bar, now that I start dealing with an excessive amount of low frequency bass noise and music all the time. I begin to lose sleep as sleeping at night doesnt become an option and sleeping in the day is limited to the ambient noise levels of that day, which can vary throughout the week.</strong></p><p><em>I believe this is also around the time my aunt-in-law also began using her sewing machine more frequently, running it for hours throughout the day, adding to the daily noise burden. The church continued holding practice sessions during the day, sometimes starting at 3 p.m. and lasting several hours, overlapping with both the bar\u2019s noise and my aunt\u2019s sewing. The situation worsened with random drumming from the church and late-night sessions that frequently went past the 10 p.m. limit set by the city noise codes. My health begins to suffer tremendously. I begin gaining weight as I am unable to keep on a consistent healthy schedule with diet, exercise or normal sleep and rest. I begin to develop a lot of anxiety now when hearing bass sounds or drumming sounds, due to trying to deal with studying or simply doing things peacefully in my home without being suddenly disturbed randomly by a loud drumming from the music class in session next door, or a random sewing machine constraining my brain positioned right above my head for hours, while knowing I also have a limited amount of time in the day before the church sessions in the evening, and before I get disrupted by the bar's music all night until 4am. Any other activities that suddenly arise such as helping my elderly parents with things in their daily life as well, now become an even heavier burden than it should, as my time is now being limited more and more, leaving me less and less of a time frame of the time I can properly use my home. My mother continues to be disturbed and is essentially forced to live around the church's schedule as well with how disruptive they are in her room. My father has recovered from his health conditions to an extent where he was able to return to work and isn't as exposed to the harmful sound conditions as me and my mom.</em></p>"

I start considering seeing a therapist from the mental fatigue and headaches I was feeling, and from dealing with the noise, particularly low frequency bass sounds. And at some point during November, or December, I mention this to my doctor and he gives me a referral for a therapist. I also began filing more frequent 311 reports against the bar in attempts to stop the noise since September, and even more in November since a 311 agent told me that if you file enough reports, the community board members review the reports at the end of each month and may take notice and take action. Meanwhile I confront my uncle again about my aunt-in-law's sewing and he shuts me down quickly and insists she doesn't really have to sew and only sews sometimes for their grand children. I get a sense he doesn't want to deal with having to ask her to stop. I mention maybe I can buy anti-vibration pads? He reiterates she doesn't have to sew and changes the subject. Juggling multiple noise issues, from multiple sources already, I focus on having him help me resolve the church issue first and decide not to press on the sewing machine further for the time being. I also inform him of the bar issue and that I've been filing 311 reports tryin to get them to stop. He informs me he knows the bar owner and sees him around sometimes, but doesn't say much after that. I let him know I've been reporting them to the police for being excessively loud. He agrees and says they are excessive and the sound reaches upstairs and my aunt-in-law can't sleep as well. I figure the bar is clearly excessive and the police certainly do have some kind of jurisdiction over them, and that eventually filing these reports will reach the right officer on duty and he will do the right thing, which is give them a ticket and deter them from continuing the excessive behavior. However, all noises and sounds continue and even ramps up more and more, as it got deeper into the holiday season.</strong></p><p><em>Here are a few videos of the sounds experienced in November: Video Links 2023 November Sound Samples 2023 November Video Samples</em></p>"

I call the precinct and receive the same responses, as in they'll send someone out. Sometimes they do, sometimes it's too late, sometimes they just make a phone call I believe. Either way, the music always resumes, and at some point late December, the bar begins using different tactics now to avert the police responses.

The church is now holding very lengthy sessions everyday of the week, sometimes up to 8 hours a day if there's a evening session, multiple days a week, with music practice or holdings classes as early as 3pm. They also have random gatherings for birthdays and other small events and allow the patrons to use the venue for private events, with the full sound system speakers, including the live band instruments. At this point, I am experiencing all 3 parties producing an abundance of low frequency sounds at excessive levels almost 16-18 hours a day, everyday. The sewing in the morning and daytime, overlapping into the evening and night with the church's daytime drumming practices or early evening music practice, and then late evening into night sessions all the way until 10pm and even past 10pm on some occasions. Then that's when the bar starts intensifying their music from 10pm until 4am, where I would finally get some quiet and be able to sleep before dealing with the same thing tomorrow morning in possibly as early as in 4 hours, cause maybe my aunt-in-law might start at 8am, sometimes 10am, it was very random at this time. The bar also blasts music when they open at 10:30AM for 15-20 minutes, everyday as well.

After Dr. Zarina informed me my hearing was fine, I did not feel the need to continue any further visits to the Doctors, and felt somewhat relieved even though I was feeling symptoms of my tinnitus here and there, and thought my hearing issues were just possibly me experiencing temporary pain and effects from the church's NYE session.

At this stage, I couldn't even coordinate with DEP inspectors to properly investigate the bar, because the bar had caught on to the police's visits and began playing music at random times\u2014alternating between being excessively loud and quiet. This left me in a position where I had to guess when they'd play loudly. The one-hour inspection window offered by the DEP in 1 - 2 months from now and scheduled before the times they're most excessive after 1am, just wasn't enough to catch them at their noisiest times, let alone display the full extent of their nuisance, especially on weekends, when the noise wasn't always consistent.

The inspectors find the church extremely excessive and we have our conversation documented on audio recordings, sound meter data logs and video prior to the inspectors arriving taken from my phone. They are amazed at how excessive the church is and mention they've never seen anything set up like this before. The inspectors find the church well over the limit and go over and issue the church multiple violations and take pictures of their set up. Almost 20 minutes after it appears the inspectors leave their establishment, the church's music comes right back on again still at an excessive level. This is a systemic issue, being they literally just got issued a summons, and turned around and continued to commit the very same violation immediately after. They essentially didn't make any attempts to even lower the noise the following weeks afterwards. Keeping in mind, they have already been notified of the issue.

The church attempts to install soundproofing, and Cesar calls me over to assure me something is being done and to have a look. I am ofcourse relieved they are finally taking meaningful steps to mitigate the disturbance after over a decade and was invited over to the church to check out the soundproofing. I see a construction professional and a patron of the church I always see, working on the wall we share. They appear to be adding another layer to the wall, with some fuzzy soundproofing material, and then another wall they informed me I believed called \"QuietRock\" on top of that, which is a type of soundproofing wall, both layers over the existing layer and with the HVAC between those walls still. I noticed the soundproofing didn't extend all the way to the end towards the front of the house, as my room on my side does, but on their side it's their main entrance/foyer for guests, for the event space on the first floor. After this observation, I ask them do they plan on completing the work all the way to the end here? They asked me why and said they weren't planning on doing it, but since I mentioned it was my bedroom, they would ask the pastor. My thoughts here were, if you're planning on doing soundproofing, you would most likely need to seal off the entire wall, but I was no expert and I just requested they please do so.(Afterwards, I am uncertain if they listened or did the work properly, because the whole time I believed I could clearly hear a sound difference in that section of the wall and room, which is about 30% of my room). Regardless, I believe this resulted in an increase in low-frequency sounds reverberating, being trapped, or amplifying inside our house. I am uncertain how to describe it specifically, but it sounded like living in a wind tunnel with unusual sounds. This is when I started noticing the strange headaches, ears popping, tinnitus attacks and faster heartbeat. During this time, I believe this is when the Hyperacusis began to really set in and get to a point of no return and I was experiencing all the symptoms I mentioned at the highest levels. In duration of a week or two while they were doing their construction, the sound in my house changed without me noticing the harmful effects. I was not able to pinpoint what it was at the time, however my ears started popping a lot, then I would get tinnitus attacks, followed by cloudy and painful headaches and then extreme dizziness and nausea, and after awhile, full on vertigo. I started to begin feeling my cognitive abilities and mental health were being affected now too, as the headaches were strange, and constricting and only in certain parts of the brain sometimes. I felt my chest tightening up, and started to get chest or heart pains along with strange muscle tightness in my chest and underarm area. I would always wake up in a rush or panic feeling my heart racing. It wasn't only stressful but the strange mental fatigue I was experiencing felt like it was preventing me from carrying out any difficult cognitive tasks and pursuing any sort of relief or help. I would feel constantly sick and nauseous even after taking medication to alleviate the nausea. Absolutely nothing helped. After the two weeks the church worked on the soundproofing along the wall we share, the pastor's son Julian, along with the church patron(not the construction guy or contractor) who was working on the wall came over to check out the sound levels before an evening session began. I mention to him the entire situation of how me and my mother have been feeling sick and that I believe it's caused by the way the soundproofing was installed. I informed him I was hearing strange low frequency sounds and vibrations possibly from the HVAC being attached along the soundproof wall, which is now trapped in between the layer of soundproof walls and materials, over the existing drywall. He replied, he believes I have sensitive hearing, and there wasn't anything wrong with their installation. I pointed out they have a huge central air unit sitting visibly on the back of the roof, and he along with the other gentleman dismiss my claim. I let him know again, to come check out the bass sounds to make sure the soundproofing works properly, since they weren't playing the drums on this occassion. I also let them know that if I do find that the soundproofing is making me sick, I am going to have to take it seriously and we'll have to go through court. To which he replied was fine implying the work was done properly. I see Julian one more time in a day or two, and ask if he's going to come check out the sounds again, because the bass is still loud. Unfortunately, he replys with \"we'll see\". This was an issue because, it felt like they weren't really taking my concerns very seriously at all anymore and they felt like they've done their due diligence and completed the work, but me and my mother were already beginning to experience health symptoms and they were worsening. Luckily, with my mother not being exposed to the bar or the sewing machine as much, her symptoms aren't as drastic and serious as mine yet. To be honest, I also feel because sees how bad my symptoms are affecting me, she doesn't want to add any additional burden onto the family as well. After informing Julian and the Church representative when they visited about me and my mother feeling sick and the soundproofing being improperly installed. I email Cesar again and attempt to describe what I'm hearing on my end, and mention the sound is actually worse in strange ways. At this point, I inform him for the last time that I suggest he hire a sound consultant/expert. The Journey for Medical Treatment Begins This is when I started reaching out to my doctors again and let them know what I was experiencing. In the following months, I first returned to Dr. Alan Levin where he diagnosed me with \"acoustic phonotrauma\" and suggested I research and get a second opinion from another expert. In June, I visited a Dr. Stephen Warman, and an Audiologist named Vasilia Meskouris. Dr. Warman diagnoses me with hyperacusis along with tinnitus and minor physical ear congestion and Dr. Meskouris mentions my hearing threshold is lower than most people my age. Dr. Warman refers me to see Dr. Sean Mcmenomey at NYU Langone for a further diagnosis and to seek treatment and Dr. Meskouris recommends I reach out to a Dr. Susan Adams. I proceed do so as soon as possible, with the NYU doctor first. Dr. Mcmenomey confirms my conditions further, provides more insight and refers me to the Center for Hearing with Dr. Susan Adams. I reach out to the center and they provide some information in regards to a possible treatment to the tune of $5500 to start, with no guarantees and an 80% success rate. As I am technically unemployed, I hold off and just focus on trying to be able to find ways to manage the condition to where I can somewhat recover, get some kind of means of sustainable consistent work and move away, and just try to get better in other ways first somehow. However, this proved to be extremely difficult and I experience a bit of shock and a lot of uncertainty. This leads me to having to isolate myself more and more often. At this point, I am extremely frustrated and file complaints to the DEP commissioners office again. This prompts the DEP to send Inspector, first name Luis I believe, to my house to take a statement from me of the ongoing issues. He tells me he'll have an inspector call me soon. It's important to note that I fully notified the Inspector Luis of my hearing issues and he is fully aware I was now seeing a doctor for these issues when taking his statement. He then proceeded to walk around outside of the bar and inspect the space. I also reached out to an Inspector Buffa as well, who is part of the DEP and he did call me back to leave me a message, but Inspector Luis came to the house a day or two after, and I didn't see the need to be in contact with multiple agents.

He informs me he can't schedule anything for the church yet, so I let him know the situation with the bar, and how it will be tricky. I mentioned I wanted the inspection conducted on the street with inspector Luis earlier and assumed he would relay everything that was said in the 30 minutes he was at the house taking my report. However later, it appears there was a miscommunication, as the inspectors that arrived was not ready to conduct an inspection from the street. This is when I spoke to the DEP again, informing them of the issue still persisting, however they inform me they can't do anything until the church has their court date for the initial summons. I then request an inspection for the bar. To which I explain the situation of how they try to hide and avoid inspections from the police currently. I let him know, for this reason, they resorted to playing after 2am the loudest because they know the police won't be able to respond by the time they close at 4am. They also turn the music up and down at random times and it varies with their playlist on certain days. Inspector Milazzo tells me he can only give me an inspection from 12am to 1am the latest, in a month from then on July 18. To which I just accept because there isn't a choice really, if I want any chance of relief. This did throw me off, as it seemed like I was reporting a crime being committed from 2 A.M. - 4 A.M. and the Inspector responded with well, we can send someone at 12 A.M. - 1 A.M.. It also seemed like they were asking me when is the best time, but at the same time, stating, we do have this time window but in 2 months from now, where a lot of harm and change could occur in the meantime. Essentially, I also felt like this also allowed for a lot of inconsistencies to be possible, as I couldn't really show the times establishment was excessive to the degree or extent they were actually being. I also felt like this is how a sound inspection should be conducted at the very least, with the element of surprise within a reasonable time frame. For example, if they just happen to be closed or not as loud on that day for whatever reason, I would have to go through the situation another 2 months, a total of 4 months now, before getting another visit. This is why I believe this process should offer more a more streamlined and transparent approach in a sense where you can just simply schedule these inspection appointments online like a DMV appointment or other appointments now available with other government agencies. The appointment should also be discrete and available upon request, not as if it's some special priviledge. The scheduled date and time of the appointment should only known to the Inspectors and system involved. This would prevent/deter favorable establishments from receiving biased inspection times and outcomes.</strong></p><p><em>My health and mental well-being worsened due to the ongoing noise issues. Despite medical evaluations and continued documentation of the noise, no substantial resolution was reached. The church's soundproofing is still improperly installed. And they were still extremely excessive without even noticing or caring enough to come back and even check if the sound was better. Everyday began feeling worse and worse. And the hope of relief seemed to be getting further and further as I found out more and more about my condition. Not only was I now aware of the imminent health symptoms and conditions that were affecting me, but I was now informed it would be permanent and the sources that caused my conditions would still be continuing their excessive behavior into my home, while the condition was severe enough where I might not be able to have the ability to get away or even fight back. Really, a feeling of knowing your inevitable demise and the decline of your health and being unable to do anything to stop it. There were times I did not know if I was just going to have to hear extremely loud and painful sounds for the rest of my life until I went crazy or just committed suicide to make it stop. Or even the matter of when and how long until this would happen. I felt I was on the brink of insanity every single day, and that was the main fight I would wake up to everyday until the end of the year.</em></p>"

I begin trying to contact 311 and get the local police to stop them again, and go through the procedure to see if they would now able to stop the noise. I add a security camera to the front of my house facing the bar, now recording any interactions they may have if the police arrive, or with their late night activities of blasting music from their cars, fighting, yelling etc. This evidence is also synced up with how I do my usual audio, video, sound meter, sound app recordings on a few occasions as well. This should show a level of consistency. I begin documenting the noise from the bar more openly, and get sound readings closer to their establishment in hopes to obtain accurate sound readings and evidence of where the source of the sound is coming from. This does feel extremely uncomfortable, especially in a neighborhood full of people, where I have lived for decades. And I can feel a sense of people wondering what I'm up to, or wondering why I might be acting strange. Regardless of the embarassment I feel at this point, I literally have no choice but to take these matters into my own hands before my own health gets worse or it starts taking a toll on my parents even more. So I try to document the issue relentlessly, but still try to maintain a level of respect for their business operation and be as quick and discrete as I can with the recordings. Mostly not to noticeable to customers and just look like I'm possibly just recording the environment. I continue trying to find ways to mitigate the noise. I begin to notice my condition worsening, however, I am still not sure what is exactly causing the symptoms, where these noises are all coming from, and how quiet does it have to be in order for me to exist without feeling sick or getting headaches. By the end of September I believe, I notice myself begin to burp excessively when being exposed to low frequency sounds, and I begin getting some chest pains, sharp pains under my arms again. I start feeling like my brain is being torn or warped as part of the headaches. Similar to the initial feelings when I first felt sick. This is horrible and lasts for as long as I'm exposed to low frequencies or whatever it is in my house. However, it does help me identify where the sounds are coming from more. I focus on trying to recover enough everyday to stay fully conscious(meaning more along the lines of maintaining some form of mental self awareness vs literally just being awake) and in a decent state of mind as long as possible. Sometimes I feel a little bit like the sounds are tearing my sanity apart from lack of sleep, and I can't fully recover fast enough before being exposed to low frequency noises or whatever it is that is making me feel horribly sick again.</strong></p><p><em>The church has made several adjustments to the soundproofing after most likely, witnessing me document their sound from my window sill on several occasions during their recent sessions, and possibly hearing me complain during my recordings as well as seeing me with hearing protection constantly now. They hire another contractor or the second contractor continued his work and made further adjustments. Now the sound is much better when they play music, however the bass still leaks through excessively, and the weird sounds and issue with the HVAC still persist now in different ways still making me feel sick and giving me headaches. This clearly showed their soundproofing mitigation attempts were still unprofessional and not done properly or with expert consultation. I record the sound often throughout the day while I'm not home and may have the construction sounds of them tearing down the walls, and hammering away when building it up again. I do have a video of when that same team was painting the walls on the balcony and door frames from the outside of the church. They did this the same time while hammering the walls, maybe to hide the fact they were tryin to fix the soundproofing. This is why I do believe that the soundproofing was adjusted once again, cause I could clearly hear and feel hammering along our shared walls. They also had a table saw set up outside as well, clearly doing major construction activity with no permits or notice to us again what so ever. I also documented the issue and reported them for construction without permits, after the first or second day I was abruptly awaken by construction sounds.</em></p>"

Regardless and unfortunately, everyday I wake up with the condition in my current living space, I go through the same thing again and again. I begin with being horribly awaken at some point(or several points if I'm able to go back to sleep, and usually every 2 hours), with certain low frequency sounds under 200 mhz exceeding as low as 20 decibels, on it's own 1/3 octave band. Which doesn't take much, especially in the daytime. My aunt's sewing machine measures at 50-60 decibels on the 120hz 1/3 octave band instantly and constantly when powered on for reference. I then leave the house and try to find quiet areas depending on the day and time, I usually have to end up in areas and places very far from where I live, and further away from the city, traffic or people. I then return home after 4am, after the bar is closed, and try to study about my condition or work on related topics, eat, sleep, and essentially try to find my way out of this endless loop. In late October, I realized I really wasn't going to be able to stay sane long enough to find cheaper treatment or treatment on my own, let alone any ways to even get some relief. Reaching out to Dr. Adams again I reach out to Dr. Adams again and she replies on Oct 22nd, this time getting a hold of the doctor personally. I schedule a 15 minute phone consultation for the next day on the 23rd, but ends up actually being on the 25th. This 15 minute phone consultation which actually turned out to be 30-40 minutes, was a huge difference and turning point of relief. Dr. Adams, was not only familiar with what I had been experiencing, but was able to explain to me and further diagnose me to an extent the other doctors weren't as specialized to do, due to the extreme rarity of the condition. She was able to give me a few mitigation tactics to help me cope but was unfortunately unable to treat me further and suggested my condition is even much more complicated than it appeared, and that I might also have other related conditions such as \"misophonia\". Dr. Adams refers me to another specialist in Connecticut she mentioned would be better suited to treat me, a Dr. Natan Bauman, a former Director of the Hearing, Speech, and Language Clinic at Yale New Haven Hospital now with his own private practice in the New Haven area. I reach out to the doctor immediately and am able to get in touch with someone after some time.

November 20th, 2024 I visit Dr.Bauman's office in Connecticut and after the initial hour evaluation, the doctor gives me a preliminary diagnosis of phonophobia along with the hyperacusis and tinnitus. He lets me know we would require further evaluation and testing on the next visit, but he did believe he may be able to help with treatment utilizing various tactics which include cognitive therapy along with specialized custom hearing devices. After some consideration about managing the costs, I decide to take the next available appointment and start the testing and evaluation to begin treatment. The doctor informs me that he would like the equipment to be ready for the evaluation, and ofcourse I agree and we purchase the hardware to be ready to begin treatment as soon as possible, immediately after the evaluation.

I felt I was able to breathe slightly better, my heart was beating normal, and my mind was more clear. The headaches subsided, and the burping stopped. Unfortunately, this didn't last for long. This is further contrasted when I return home, and start feeling the symptoms I experienced before start coming back almost immediately. This pushes me to believe my suspicions with the faulty soundproofing and I start contacting the authorities again with the new information. I contact the D.E.P for strange sounds and for their music still being excessively loud, as well as the D.O.B for unapproved construction contrary to plans, as I realized if they didn't get a professional sound consulatant and I saw no permits outside on all those times they did construction, that they may have not followed proper building codes and construction procedures. My aunt continues to sew randomly throughout the day despite being fully aware of the seriousness of my condition now. The bar also continues their excessive behavior during the afterhours all the way til 4:00 A.M. every day. The church's sound levels are still in violation, however I did notify the police to inform them of it, and I am currently waiting to see if the pattern will continue. I am also awaiting another DEP inspection for both parties, and hopefully to also discuss with the inspector the options I have with my aunt-in-law/landlady and her use of the industrial sewing machine. I continue to contact the authorities in regards to the situation with the bar and try to find a way to escalate the issue with the police due to the bar's aversion tactics, and DEP's difficulties with scheduling and availability. If anyone can give these guys a ticket to deter them or find evidence of the disturbance and nuisance, it should most likely be the authorities that are located about a few blocks away from the bar. However, this proves extremely difficult with only filing 311 reports and providing details through 311 channels or even calling the 110th Precinct.</strong></p><p><em>The officer's all have a variety of different responses, which essentially further deflects and actually just passes on the responsibility to other departments. The officer's responses vary from things like: they are only able to give the bar a verbal warning, to yes we can give them tickets, to no we can't give them tickets, to call the DOB, call the community board, repeating things like, \"we'll they're a commercial establishment and is allowed to play music\", to which I replied, yes, but certainly not to excessive sound levels. An Officer Cazzo or Casso, from the 110th precinct iterated the same thing as well on a recent phone call. He seemed adamant the bar was not committing any crimes and they were not able to help with more than a verbal warning each time. I let him know it's not logical for the bar to be making the same excessive sounds, and sound levels as a car with a loud exhaust in violation, but not be able to receive tickets. He lets me know, well the car is passing by and goes away, to which I confirm as he just proved my point to himself? I let him know that, it's even worse when the source is stationary for 6-8 hours in front of your house every night then. I was confused there, and I pointed out the inconsistency. So again, the police appear to provide another excuse, reason, or explaination on behalf of the bar. He relinquishes a little and agrees. He then informs me I would have to just keep calling them each time the bar was excessive, which seemed like a complete failure to resolve an on-going issue. I mention it's not a crime but it must be some sort of violation. He puts me on hold for about 15 minutes, and I hear him pick up the phone a few times to see if I hung up. Eventually I simply call back and ask for a lieutenant. The officer then quickly reassures me they are doing absolutely everything they can to resolve the issue. I push a little more and let him know that I'm already seeing a doctor for hearing conditions, I am looking to escalate the issue because it hasn't been resolved in over a year and going into 2 years now. I inform him I would like to speak to a higher ranking officer than the neighborhood coordinator, who they keep sending me to and I've spoken to on multiple occasions already. The officer denies me again and tries to change the subject away from escalating. Regardless, I could clearly see what was happening, and I decided to let him know this is a failure of the system and that I would be continuing to find ways to escalate the issue. It's also important to mention I also made sure Officer Cazzo/Casso was aware I now have a hearing condition and have began seeing doctors. So I once again informed the authorities of the seriousness and urgency of the position I am in. A few days later, after emailing the DEP myself again, two days later on January 6, I receive an email from the DEP stating they've been contacted by the police department and would like to help set up an inspection. I filled out the form and await their call.</em></p>"
