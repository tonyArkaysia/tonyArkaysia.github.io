  <h2>Unsafe Vibrations from Faulty Construction</h2>
  <p>
    The church next door installed a commercial HVAC unit directly onto our shared structural wall. This setup causes daily structural vibrations to pass through the wall and into my home. These vibrations have made the space unsafe for anyone sensitive to noise, especially someone with my condition.
  </p>

  <h2>Failed Soundproofing Installation</h2>
  <p>
    In May 2024, the church installed a wall meant to reduce noise. They never consulted a licensed soundproofing expert. Their side of the shared wall is now treated, while my side is completely untreated and vulnerable. Because of this imbalance, low-frequency noise and vibrations get trapped and pushed into my side, making things worse.
  </p>

  <h2>No Impact Study or Permit</h2>
  <p>
    The soundproofing work was done without any permits or inspections. No environmental sound impact study was done on my side to see how their changes affected me. They built something without considering the health and safety of the people living on the other side of the wall.
  </p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This page shows that the soundproofing and HVAC installation made my condition worse. The judge should understand that this was not just noise—it was mechanical vibration transmitted through the walls. It happened because the church made construction decisions without care or oversight, and I’ve had to suffer the consequences in my own home.
